# ANTI-AI-TELL WRITING RULES
## Universal Humanization Logic for AI Novel Generation

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Purpose**: Prevent robotic writing patterns across ALL genres

---

## 1. SENTENCE OPENING VARIETY

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Overuse of "The [noun] [verb]" patterns
- Too many participial phrases opening sentences
- Mechanical alternation of sentence structures

### ✅ FIX:
- **Mix short and long sentences irregularly** - Real writers don't alternate with mathematical precision
- **Use pronouns more freely** - "He walked" not "Bernard's feet carried him"
- **Vary paragraph rhythms** - Not every paragraph needs 3-4 sentences
- **Allow mundane openings** - "There was a knock" is fine. Not everything needs flair.

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
SENTENCE OPENING DISCIPLINE:
- Maximum 1 participial phrase opening per page
- If you open with "The [noun]", next 3 sentences must use different structures
- Track your sentence beginnings - if 3 consecutive paragraphs start similarly, rewrite
- Some sentences can be plain: "He walked to the door." No poetry required.
```

---

## 2. METAPHOR RATIONING

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Every action gets an elaborate simile/metaphor
- Descriptions become "purple prose" (overwrought, flowery)
- Metaphors compete for attention instead of enhancing meaning

### ✅ FIX:
- **1 strong metaphor per scene maximum** - Make it count, then stop
- **Reserve metaphors for important moments** - Not "the ladder groaned like a confessor"
- **Use direct description** - "The ladder creaked" is often better than elaborate comparison
- **Kill your darlings** - If a metaphor feels clever, cut it

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
METAPHOR DISCIPLINE:
- Maximum 1 simile/metaphor per 500 words
- No metaphors for mundane actions (walking, sitting, picking up objects)
- If comparing to "like a [complex thing]", delete and use simple adjective instead
- Test: Can the sentence work without the metaphor? If yes, cut the metaphor.
```

---

## 3. PHYSICAL RESPONSE VARIATION

### ❌ AI TELL:
- "Stomach dropped/tightened/clenched" (used 6+ times in this manuscript)
- "Heat crept up neck/face" (repeated pattern)
- "Hands trembled/shook" (constant reminder of nervousness)

### ✅ FIX:
- **Show emotion through action, not bodily sensation** - Character counts prayer beads vs. "his stomach tightened"
- **Use physical cues ONCE per chapter maximum**
- **Trust the reader** - If scene context is tense, you don't need to tell us stomachs are tight
- **Vary the physiology** - Jaw clenching, breathing changes, posture shifts, eye movements

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
PHYSICAL RESPONSE RULES:
- Ban these phrases entirely: "stomach dropped/tightened", "heat crept", "hands trembled"
- Physical anxiety cues: Maximum 1 per scene, must be unique each time
- Prefer action over sensation: Character does something nervous vs. feeling nervousness
- If character is anxious, show through behavior not visceral description
```

---

## 4. SENSORY DETAIL ECONOMY

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Every scene has exhaustive smell/sight/sound catalog
- Kitchen scenes always have 3-5 smell descriptors
- Descriptions feel like grocery lists: "cinnamon and cardamom and leather and wool"

### ✅ FIX:
- **One dominant sense per scene** - Pick smell OR sight, not both exhaustively
- **Anchor in specificity** - "The bread smelled of honey" not "honey and yeast and warmth and comfort and..."
- **Sensory details only when character would notice** - No omniscient smell catalogs
- **Less is more** - Two vivid details beat five generic ones

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
SENSORY DISCIPLINE:
- Choose ONE dominant sense per scene (smell OR sight OR sound)
- Maximum 2 sensory details per paragraph
- No lists of smells/sights - pick the MOST important one
- Character must have reason to notice - don't catalog everything
```

---

## 5. DIALOGUE TAG SIMPLICITY

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Overuse of "whispered/mumbled/managed/observed/announced"
- Constantly modifying speech: "his voice cracking/squeaking/climbing"
- Avoiding simple "said"

### ✅ FIX:
- **"Said" is your friend** - Use it 80% of the time
- **Action beats over tags** - "He looked away. 'I don't know.'" not "he said nervously"
- **Let dialogue carry emotion** - The words show tone, tags don't need to
- **When varying, use only**: asked, whispered, shouted, called - that's it

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
DIALOGUE TAG RULES:
- Use "said" for 80% of dialogue tags
- Allowed alternatives ONLY: asked, whispered, shouted, called
- BANNED: mumbled, managed, observed, announced, continued, breathed, offered, ventured
- NO adverbs with "said" - "he said quietly" becomes "He lowered his voice. 'Text.'"
- Prefer action beats: "He turned away. 'I'm fine.'" not "'I'm fine,' he said, turning away"
```

---

## 6. CHAPTER ENDING VARIETY

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Every chapter ends with one-sentence philosophical observation
- Nature/weather used as metaphorical punctuation
- Predictable rhythm: action → reflection → poetic end line

### ✅ FIX:
- **Vary ending types**:
  - Dialogue (mid-conversation cliffhanger)
  - Action (someone enters/something breaks)
  - Decision (character makes choice, no reflection)
  - Silence (end on image, no commentary)
- **Cut philosophical capstones** - Not every chapter needs wisdom
- **End earlier than feels complete** - Create forward momentum

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
CHAPTER ENDING RULES:
- BANNED: Ending with nature/weather observation
- BANNED: One-sentence philosophical reflection as final line
- Required: Alternate ending types:
  * 25% - Mid-dialogue
  * 25% - Physical action (someone arrives, object breaks)
  * 25% - Character decision (shown, not reflected upon)
  * 25% - Abrupt image (describe scene, stop)
- Test: Delete last sentence. Is ending stronger? If yes, delete it.
```

---

## 7. NUMERICAL SPECIFICITY DISCIPLINE

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Hyper-specific counts that don't matter: "Fifty-nine. Sixty. Perfect."
- Listing exact numbers for atmosphere: "Seventy-three guests, twenty-two probables, sixteen maybes"
- Numbers used as characterization crutch (Bernard counts everything)

### ✅ FIX:
- **Specific numbers only when plot-relevant** - "Six barrels" matters to wine shortage
- **Use vague quantities for atmosphere** - "dozens of guests" not "seventy-three"
- **Character tics need variation** - If Bernard counts things, show it 2-3 times total, not every scene
- **Trust the reader** - We understand anxiety without constant counting demonstrations

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
NUMERICAL SPECIFICITY RULES:
- Only use exact numbers when plot requires it (money, time, quantities that matter to conflict)
- For atmosphere: "many", "several", "a few" - no exact counts
- Character counting tic: Maximum 2 instances per novel, not per chapter
- Delete number if you can replace with "some/many/few" without losing meaning
```

---

## 8. WEATHER-EMOTION INDEPENDENCE

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Thunder arrives when disaster strikes
- Rain cleanses/transforms at emotional climax
- Sunshine appears when problems resolve
- Weather always mirrors internal states (pathetic fallacy)

### ✅ FIX:
- **Weather exists independently of emotion** - It can rain during happy scenes
- **Use weather for contrast** - Sunny day during tragedy creates tension
- **Establish weather early** - Don't introduce storm only when needed emotionally
- **Weather affects logistics, not just mood** - Rain makes roads muddy, that's it

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
WEATHER DISCIPLINE:
- Establish weather at scene start, don't introduce mid-scene for emotional effect
- Weather must affect plot/logistics, not just mirror emotion
- Deliberately mismatch weather and emotion at least once per act:
  * Happy scene in rain
  * Sad scene in sunshine  
  * Tense scene in calm weather
- Ban: Thunder arriving exactly when bad news hits
```

---

## 9. CHARACTER TIC RESTRAINT

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Character trait shown in EVERY scene they appear
- Bernard clicks beads, Pierre breaks things, Eloise experiments - every single time
- Tics become character's entire personality

### ✅ FIX:
- **Establish tic 2-3 times, then trust reader remembers**
- **Show tic only when stressed** - Not constant baseline behavior
- **Characters have multiple traits** - Bernard can be anxious without always counting
- **Tics evolve** - By end, Bernard doesn't need beads as much (growth)

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
CHARACTER TIC RULES:
- Introduce character tic maximum 3 times in entire novel
- Tic only appears when character is under unusual stress
- Each character needs 3-4 distinct traits/behaviors, rotate through them
- Character arc: Early chapters show tic often, later chapters rarely (show growth)
- If tic appeared in previous chapter, skip it in current chapter
```

---

## 10. ELEGANT VARIATION SYNDROME FIX

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Refusing to repeat simple words
- Monastery becomes: "St. Jude's / the community / these walls / the grounds / the faithful space"
- Creates awkward synonyms to avoid repetition

### ✅ FIX:
- **Repeat important nouns freely** - "Bernard" not "the monk / the anxious brother / the festival organizer"
- **Use pronouns** - "He" is invisible, use it liberally
- **Key terms should repeat** - Monastery, Bernard, festival - say them directly
- **Variation only for emphasis** - Synonym signals you mean something different

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
WORD REPETITION RULES:
- Character names: Use their name or pronoun "he/she" - no synonyms
- Key locations: Call it the same thing every time (monastery = monastery)
- Plot-critical objects: Repeat exact noun - don't vary for style
- Pronouns are invisible: Use "he/she/it" freely, readers don't notice repetition
- Only vary when meaning differs: "Bernard" vs "the festival organizer" only if role matters in that moment
```

---

## 11. ELLIPSES & EM-DASH ADDICTION

### ❌ AI TELL:
- Characters trail off constantly: "I just... I don't know... maybe..."
- Em-dashes everywhere: "The festival—three months away—required..."
- Hesitation becomes personality for EVERY character
- Average 9-10 per chapter (vs. human writers: 2-3)

### ✅ FIX:
- **Complete your sentences** - "I don't know" is stronger than "I don't know..."
- **Maximum 3 ellipses per chapter total** - Reserve for actual interruption/trailing off
- **Maximum 2 em-dashes per chapter** - Use commas or periods instead
- **Show hesitation through action** - Character pauses, looks away - not through punctuation
- **Confidence in ending** - Let sentences finish with periods

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
PUNCTUATION DISCIPLINE:
- Ellipses (...): Maximum 3 per chapter, ONLY when:
  * Character is actually interrupted mid-sentence by another speaker
  * Character faints/loses consciousness mid-thought
  * NOT for: uncertainty, nervousness, hesitation, "searching for words"
  
- Em-dashes (—): Maximum 2 per chapter, ONLY when:
  * Sudden topic shift mid-sentence is plot-critical
  * Parenthetical that can't work with commas
  * NOT for: every aside, every clarification, every interruption
  
- Show hesitation through action beats:
  ❌ "I just... I don't know..."
  ✅ He looked away. "I don't know."
  
  ❌ "The festival—three months away—required..."
  ✅ "The festival required preparation. Three months wasn't enough."
  
- Periods are your friend. Use them confidently.
```

---

## 12. "PERFECTLY" ADDICTION & LAZY INTENSIFIERS

### ❌ AI TELL:
- "Perfectly prepared" "perfectly timed" "perfectly positioned"
- Every positive thing is "perfect" - 23 times in one manuscript
- Lazy intensification instead of specific description
- "Completely", "absolutely", "entirely", "utterly" overuse

### ✅ FIX:
- **Ban "perfectly" unless thematically justified** - If novel explores perfection, allow it. Otherwise, delete.
- **Describe instead of intensify** - "The bread was golden" not "perfectly baked"
- **Most things aren't perfect** - Real life has flaws, embrace them
- **Cut all intensifiers first draft** - Then add back only 2-3 if truly needed

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
INTENSIFIER DISCIPLINE:
- BANNED UNLESS THEMATIC: perfectly, completely, absolutely, entirely, utterly, totally
- Allowed uses of "perfectly":
  * Thematic opposition: "perfectly imperfect" if perfection is plot theme
  * Mathematical/technical: "perfectly aligned gears" for machinery
  * Maximum 2 instances per chapter IF thematically justified
  
- Replace intensifiers with specific details:
  ❌ "perfectly prepared feast"
  ✅ "feast with roasted lamb, honey bread, and spiced wine"
  
  ❌ "completely exhausted"
  ✅ "exhausted enough to sleep through Prime"
  
  ❌ "absolutely certain"
  ✅ "certain as stone"
  
- Delete-first strategy:
  * Write chapter
  * Search for: perfectly, completely, absolutely, entirely, utterly
  * Delete ALL instances
  * Read without them - still works? Keep deleted.
  * Sounds wrong? Add back MAXIMUM 1-2 with better word choice
```

---

## 13. "COMPLETELY" OVERUSE IN EMOTIONAL STATES

### ❌ AI TELL:
- "completely unperturbed" "completely unfazed" "completely exhausted"
- Using "completely" for emotional/mental states that don't need intensification
- V3 manuscript had 7 "completely" uses (target: 4-5 total across manuscript)
- Makes prose feel overstated and less confident

### ✅ FIX:
- **Physical actions can keep "completely"** - "work completely free", "surrender completely to physics" (object/action reached completion)
- **Delete "completely" from emotional states** - "unperturbed" is stronger than "completely unperturbed"
- **Manuscript-wide target: 4-5 total** - Reserve for physical completion, not emotional intensification
- **Trust adjectives alone** - They already describe the state fully

**PROMPT INSTRUCTION**:
```
"COMPLETELY" SURGICAL REMOVAL:
- Physical completion (KEEP if essential):
  ✅ "work completely free" - stone reached complete detachment
  ✅ "surrender completely to physics" - action finished entirely
  ? "crumbles completely" - consider just "crumbles" (action is clear)
  
- Emotional/mental states (DELETE):
  ❌ "completely unperturbed" → ✅ "unperturbed"
  ❌ "completely unfazed" → ✅ "unfazed"  
  ❌ "completely exhausted" → ✅ "exhausted" or ✅ "exhausted enough to collapse"
  ❌ "gone completely mad" → ✅ "gone mad" (even in dialogue)
  
- Manuscript target: Maximum 4-5 uses of "completely" across ALL chapters
- Each use must justify itself: Does it add meaning, or just volume?
- When in doubt, delete. Strong verbs and adjectives work alone.
```

## MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE

**Add this to `config/prompt_templates/chapter.yaml`**:

```yaml
anti_ai_tell_instructions: |
  CRITICAL WRITING DISCIPLINE - APPLY TO EVERY PARAGRAPH:
  
  1. SENTENCE OPENINGS: Track patterns. If 2 consecutive paragraphs open similarly, rewrite one.
  2. METAPHOR QUOTA: Maximum 1 simile/metaphor per 500 words. Reserve for important moments.
  3. PHYSICAL RESPONSES: Ban "stomach dropped/tightened", "heat crept", "hands trembled". Max 1 unique physical cue per scene.
  4. SENSORY DETAILS: Choose ONE dominant sense per scene. Maximum 2 sensory details per paragraph.
  5. DIALOGUE TAGS: Use "said" 80% of time. Only alternatives: asked, whispered, shouted, called.
  6. CHAPTER ENDINGS: Rotate types - dialogue, action, decision, image. NO philosophical one-liners.
  7. NUMBERS: Only specific counts when plot-critical. Use "several/many" for atmosphere.
  8. WEATHER: Establish early, mismatch with emotion deliberately, affects logistics not just mood.
  9. CHARACTER TICS: Maximum 3 times per novel. Show only under stress. Tics should fade as character grows.
  10. WORD CHOICE: Repeat key nouns freely. Use character names or pronouns - no elegant synonyms.
  11. ELLIPSES/EM-DASHES: Maximum 3 ellipses + 2 em-dashes per chapter. Use periods confidently.
  12. INTENSIFIERS: Ban "perfectly/completely/absolutely/entirely" unless thematic. Describe specifically instead.
  13. "COMPLETELY" SURGICAL REMOVAL: Delete from emotional states ("completely unperturbed"→"unperturbed"). Keep ONLY for physical completion if essential. Target: 4-5 uses across entire manuscript.
  
  SELF-CHECK BEFORE SUBMITTING:
  - Count your metaphors - cut if more than 1 per 500 words
  - Find every "said" alternative - replace 80% with "said"
  - Delete last sentence of chapter - is it stronger? If yes, keep it deleted
  - Scan for "stomach/heat/hands" physical cues - delete and show through action instead
  - Circle every specific number - delete if you can say "several/many/few" instead
  - Search for "..." - maximum 3 per chapter, delete the rest and use periods
  - Search for "perfectly/absolutely" - delete ALL, then add back max 1-2 if essential
  - Search for "completely" - count instances. Delete from emotional states. Keep ONLY physical completion if adds meaning. Target: 0-1 per chapter, 4-5 manuscript total.
  
  REMEMBER: Simple, direct prose beats clever writing. Trust your reader. Trust your story.
  Periods are powerful. Complete sentences show confidence. Let dialogue breathe without trailing off.
```

---

## TESTING PROTOCOL

After generating new chapter with these rules:

1. **Word frequency check**: Search for banned phrases ("stomach dropped", etc.)
2. **Metaphor count**: Should find 1-2 max per chapter, not 15-20
3. **Dialogue tag audit**: 80% should be "said" or action beats
4. **Chapter ending test**: Does it avoid philosophical capstone pattern?
5. **Sensory catalog check**: No scenes with 5+ smell/sight descriptors

---

## NOTES FOR FUTURE REFINEMENT

- These rules are **genre-agnostic** - apply equally to Christian romance, sci-fi thriller, historical drama, etc.
- They target **structural patterns** not content (never says "don't use religious language" or genre-specific advice)
- Focus on **how AI writes** (repetitive structures, over-explanation, predictability) not **what it writes about**
- Rules can be adjusted per novel based on style goals, but defaults should prevent 90% of AI tells

**This document should be read by Claude before generating ANY chapter in ANY genre.**
