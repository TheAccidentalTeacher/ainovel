PART ONE

“I will make a covenant of peace with them.
It shall be an everlasting covenant with them.
And I will set them in their land and multiply them,
and will set my sanctuary in their midst forevermore.
My dwelling place shall be with them,
and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.”

Ezekiel 37:26-27
 


1. PRUNING DAY

Hongdae District, Seoul, South Korea
Pruning Day
As far as first dates went, Jiwon’s night out had been practically perfect. Sure, it would have been better if her heel hadn’t snapped off as soon as she stepped down from the subway, but then Seojun wouldn’t have made such a fuss over her or let her lean on him all the way to the restaurant.
Jiwon had already told her sister that if tonight didn’t go well, she would delete that stupid Instalove app and swear off internet dating for good.
Maybe she wouldn’t be deactivating her account after all.
Of course, Seojun wasn’t entirely flawless. He was a little older than he looked in his profile picture, and she was certain he’d added a few fictitious inches to his height. Then again, was that any worse than the filters she’d played around with when she set up her account?
“Did you save any room for dessert?” he asked, smiling at her from across the table. For the first time, she noticed a little gap between his two front teeth, a gap she was certain hadn’t shown up in his perfect grin online.
Her sister always warned her about coming off too eager. “Maybe,” Jiwon answered coyly and twirled a strand of hair around her finger. She was glad she’d let her sister talk her into that manicure yesterday. Several times over dinner she’d caught Seojun admiring the sparkling studs and bright colors on her nails. The teal reminded her of the magical northern lights. One day she’d love to go see them. One day. There certainly wasn’t any rush. But who knew? Maybe she’d end up marrying Seojun and they’d honeymoon on an arctic cruise …
“You up for some bingsu?” he asked. A little dimple flashed on his cheek. “I know a great place.”
She glanced around the restaurant, trying to appear as if she was weighing her decision before answering. “Sure, I guess I could do that.”
They were getting up from the table when a siren shrieked. At first Jiwon was startled, then annoyed. Nobody had announced any drills, and they never practiced air raids this late. She thought about her sister, at home with a toddler who’d just barely learned to sleep through the night. What were these idiots thinking?
Then all at once, the sound of dozens of dings and beeps and texts rang out through the restaurant. Jiwon stared at her phone.
Emergency alert. Missile threat detected. Take shelter immediately in nearest underground facility or safe structure.
Emergency? That didn’t make any …
A man swore from the back of the restaurant, his words piercing the air for a second as if completely frozen in time. Next, after the stillness, was shouting, pushing, shoving. 
Jiwon stood frozen for a terrible, paralyzing moment.
Fingers dug into her bare arm. Her date? She’d completely forgotten he existed. This morning, she hadn’t even heard his name or seen his profile picture. Now, they were holding each other and running out of the restaurant, panting in the darkness. On the street now, hurrying toward the subway. Somewhere on the stairs her broken heel flew off. What was that story of Cinderella and the slipper? Maybe once the drill was over, Seojun would go and find it for her. That’s how she’d know he was meant to be hers.
Except this wasn’t a drill. Or was it? Nothing made sense. All she knew was that if she stopped running, she’d be knocked down by the desperate bodies rushing into the tunnel.
“In here.” Seojun dragged her into the entrance of an underground shop. It was already chained up for the night, but if they pressed up against the gate, they were protected from the throngs. 
She didn’t think her heart had ever raced so fast. She needed to call her sister. She needed to call her mom. 
She needed to get home and away from these crowds. 
“Are you getting a cell signal?” she yelled at her date, but she could scarcely hear her own voice over the shrill sirens and screams of the masses.
“Everyone’s going farther down,” Seojun shouted, his gaze fixed on all the people racing to the lower levels of the subway. “Maybe we should —” 
But those were the last words that Jiwon ever heard.
 


2. THE LAST CALM

20 hours before the Pruning
Rachel warmed her hands on her mug of tea while she waited for the fried eggs to crisp. The familiar sound of iron dropping on concrete clanged from the basement.
“He’s down there already?” her husband asked as he descended the stairs, working the buttons on his flannel. Rachel smiled at the lopsided mess he’d created and stepped forward to help him.
“Thank you, ma’am.” Caleb grinned at her. “You gonna tie my shoes for me too? Maybe spit on your finger and wipe grime off my face?”
“Not with that beard,” Rachel answered. “But you better hurry. It’s chest day. You know what that means.”
Before heading to the basement, Caleb glanced at the stove. “Bacon?” 
“It’s in the air fryer,” she told him with a roll of her eyes. 
“Then why don’t I smell anything?”
Rachel tilted her head to the side. “Actually, you’re right.” She pulled the air fryer door open.
Caleb leaned down, staring at the slabs of raw meat. “Helps if you turn it on, babe.”
“I did. I’m sure of it.” Rachel stuck her hand toward the door. “See, it’s warm. It must have shut itself off.”
“Probably another one of those stupid power fluctuations. Welcome to winter in Glennallen.”
Caleb shut the air fryer door and turned the machine back on. It whirled as it began to reheat breakfast.
“All right.” Rachel gave her husband a playful pat on his backside. “Now that you know you aren’t going to starve, you better get downstairs before …”
“Hey, baldie.” The door to the basement burst open with a flourish, and the Winters’ son stood staring at his dad.
“Does my little baby boy need help with the big heavy weights?” Caleb teased in a sing-song voice. 
“No, I need a spot, you idiot.”
“So, you’re going for a personal record today?” Caleb asked, serious this time.
“Yeah,” Tic answered, “if you ever stop being a lazy moron and actually come help me.”
Rachel shook her head and went back to the stove. She’d never fully understand the way her son and husband taunted each other, but Caleb always assured her it was their own special love language.
“It’s a PR day,” Caleb told her. “Want to come watch?”
Rachel tried not to visibly cringe even as she felt her body tense. When Caleb first got their son into weightlifting, it was a cute way for their ten-year-old to spend special time with his dad, bonding over sweat and iron in the chilly, unfinished basement they never got around to carpeting. Six years later, with Tic constantly striving to set one new personal record after another, she was always terrified of injuries. It wouldn’t be so bad if they weren’t so rural, but out in Glennallen they were remote enough that a torn rotator cuff would mean a medevac airlift or at least a four-hour drive to the nearest hospital.
She bit her tongue before she could say anything to betray her fear and instead returned to her cooking. “Breakfast will be ready when you come back up,” she told them both and said a prayer for Tic, whom she’d never stop thinking of as her baby boy.
A whine from outside told her that her dog was ready to come in. She tightened the belt of her fuzzy bathrobe before bracing herself for the wave of icy blast that ambushed her as soon as she cracked open the door. Winter in Glennallen was never comfortable, but the wind today made the dark morning chill especially brutal. 
Her chocolate-colored spaniel Chamomile rushed in, shaking her body as if trying to throw off the cold clinging to her silky fur. 
“Come on, Cammy.” Rachel tapped her chest, urging her dog to stand on her hind legs so she could wrap her up in her fuzzy robe for a few seconds. Feeling the cold drifting in from outside, she lifted up another worried mother’s prayer, this time for her daughter who was studying at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks.
Winters in Glennallen could get cold, but the weather up north was even more extreme.
God, please help Yaya to stay healthy before midterms. Her simple prayer wasn’t even the start of what she wanted to pray to give voice to all her worries for her daughter. She just hoped that God would understand her words to mean so much more than a blessing over her daughter’s health and schoolwork: Please help Yaya to be well, to not be homesick, to be getting along well with her roommate. Help her not be lonely or hungry or cold or tired or sick. And please, God, help my little girl come back to you and love you like she used to before …
The silent pleadings from Rachel’s soul were interrupted by a violent, thunderous roar from downstairs. Before her conscious brain could process what was happening, Rachel was racing down the basement steps, hardly aware that she’d spilled hot tea on herself in her haste.
“What was that?” she cried desperately, bracing herself for the sight of her son flattened beneath a ton of weights or her husband dead on the floor from a heart attack. “Did someone get hurt?”
Caleb walked over and silently put a hand on her shoulder, a signal that spoke to her body even more than her mind, a signal that told her everything was fine. “Your son just hit his second personal record of the year on the bench press.”
Rachel let out her breath, her entire body still shaking from fear and adrenaline. Back when the kids were toddlers, she imagined life would be so much easier once a few years passed and she would stop worrying about them so much. Nobody told her it only got harder the older they became. 
Noting the beams of pride on both Caleb and Tic’s faces, Rachel threw her arms around her son, sweaty hoodie and all. “Great job, Tychicus. That’s really impressive.”
“Yeah,” Caleb joked, “if you’re a puny little wuss.”
“235 was easy,” Tic told him. “I could have done 240 easy, except you’re too scared to let me beat your record.”
“No.” Caleb flattened his voice to the serious teacher tone that worked miracles managing his middle-school students. “I don’t want you to get hurt. Your mother worries enough about you as it is.”
Rachel thought about her slightly unhinged race down the stairs and did her best to keep her proud-mother smile plastered on her face. “Well, either way, you did a great job and I’m sure you’re hungry, so let’s go upstairs and eat.”
Cammy, who had cautiously followed Rachel down to the basement, performed a happy spin at the word eat. She raced upstairs to her best begging position beneath the Winters’ table. 
Tic ran to change out of his workout clothes while Caleb grabbed a plate and dished up a hearty serving of bacon and eggs.
“Save some for Tic,” Rachel scolded when she saw how much he’d piled on his plate.
Caleb just chuckled. “You know that kid’s already had like a thousand calories from his protein shake. He’ll be fine. Besides, I can’t have him bulking up too fast, or he really will beat my record. And I’m just not sure I’m ready for him to be officially stronger than me yet.”
Rachel poured her husband a cup of coffee and sat down with her breakfast as Tic arrived dressed for school. Eyeing his father’s plate, he grabbed a large piece of bacon and shoved the entire slab into his mouth before Caleb could react. Rachel shot him a look but was secretly pleased to know her baby boy, who was nothing like a baby any longer, wouldn’t go to school hungry.
Caleb stretched out his arms, and the family clasped hands around the circular table Tic had built last year in woodshop. It was small enough that even with Yaya missing, they could all reach out to each other.
The family bowed their heads, and Rachel breathed in the smell of coffee and bacon grease and teenage boy and thanked God for her family, for their home, and for what promised to be a peaceful day ahead.

***

Caleb kissed his wife on the top of her head and grabbed his school bag. “Have a great day, babe. We’ll see you this afternoon.” 
“Need some more coffee for the road?” Rachel asked.
Caleb shook his head. “Nah, thanks.” He smiled down at her, and the moment he saw her tilt her head to the side he knew the words she would say before they came out of her mouth.
“Don’t you want a coat?”
He glanced at the digital thermometer hanging by the front door. “It’s only five below. What are you talking about?”
Tic bounded down the stairs, with Cammy looking adoringly at him as she wagged her tail stump.
“Tic,” Rachel said sternly. “Get your coat.”
Caleb watched bemused as their son glanced at the temperature then turned back to Rachel. “It’s only five below.”
Caleb put his arm on Tic’s shoulder. “Son, listen to your mother. Get your coat.”
“I don’t see you wearing one, old man.”
Sometimes Caleb missed the days when Tic was little, convinced that his parents could do nothing wrong. “I’ve got my coat in the truck,” Caleb said, even though he was only half sure it was true. Had he taken it out before his last trip to town?
“Have a good Friday, you two,” Rachel said. As Caleb watched her hug their son good-bye, he couldn’t get over his surprise at how tall Tic had grown. He had to be at least nine inches taller than his mom, but of course, next to Rachel, that wasn’t saying all that much. Still, when had Tic grown into such a young man? What had happened to that scrawny little boy who used to follow Caleb around, hanging onto his every word? He shook the image out of his head the way their spaniel shook snow off her coat in a blizzard.
“Let’s go, idiot,” he said to his son. 
“After you, moron.” Once they got to the school, the good-natured name-calling and banter would tone down, but never entirely stop. It was a secret code the two of them shared. Secretly, Caleb hoped neither of them would outgrow it.
Outside, the morning was dark and cool. At least they’d had a decent snowfall so far this year, enough to insulate the sides of the house and cover the backyard in a heavy white blanket. Cammy yapped at them once from the kitchen window as they climbed into the truck. 
“How’s basketball going?” he asked Tic as they started the drive to school.
Tic detailed all the latest sports drama — who got caught vaping in the bathroom, who was on academic probation. None of it was news to Caleb, who was one of the first to learn what was happening at the school, but he still liked the chance to get Tic’s take on it all.
“Have you heard from your sister lately?” he asked.
“Nah, you know Yaya. If she’s not responding to something in the family chat we never talk.”
Caleb didn’t respond. Three years apart in age, his kids hadn’t been close since they were little. On the up side, that meant they never fought, but they barely seemed to know each other. At the heart of the problem was how different they were. Tic was into sports and weight-lifting, the big man on campus at the small K-12 Glennallen school. Yaya was quiet and studious, graduating with perfect grades, a couple close friends from theater, and a dream to become a famous architect. 
And of course, there were the faith differences. Tic had always been interested in religion, dragging Caleb into late-night discussions on topics ranging from Bible translations to end-times theology to everyday questions of how to live a pure and godly life when you’re surrounded by temptations on every side. Yaya, on the other hand, never gelled with the kids her age from church, couldn’t stand some of the hardline approaches Caleb took on the authority of Scripture, and was now living as a professed atheist at a secular college campus.
As worries for his daughter swirled in his mind, Caleb turned onto the small road that led to the school. Soon, his day would be filled with science and history and laughing preteens with their slang so outrageous that he practically needed a new dictionary every week to keep up. He took the last few seconds of his commute to transition from Dad to Mr. Winters, Glennallen’s most enthusiastic and energetic middle-school teacher. 
Even before the truck was in park, Tic jumped out to greet his friends, leaving Caleb alone with his plans for the day, his hopes for his students, and the darkness and chill of a Glennallen winter. In his periphery, Caleb thought he noticed the soft green flicker of the northern lights in the west, but as soon as he turned to face them, they were gone.

Dubai International Airport, United Arab Emirates
Pruning Day
Work at the tower was never boring, which is why Rafiq loved his job. 
He sometimes would look back and laugh at the way his father and grandfather lectured him when he was growing up: Rafiq, why are you always fidgeting? Stop moving around. Stop messing with the fringe on that rug. Stop taking everything down off your grandmother’s shelves. Stop touching everything you see. Be quiet. Be calm. Be still.
Little did they know that the same nervous energy that got him swatted a time or two as a child had served him so perfectly well as an adult working in the tower.
“If your father were alive, he’d be so proud,” his mother had told him last week over dinner. He still couldn’t believe it was nearly three years since his father passed. Where had the time gone? And why did he miss him so much, as if the grief were hours old and not years?
Thankful for work to distract him, he reached out and adjusted his volume to better hear the pilot in his headset. “Approach, Falcon 452, holding at Tango. Request descent for 12R.”
Rafiq gave clearance while monitoring Falcon’s progress on the screen. Memories of his father had made him pensive. While he simultaneously scanned the radar and tracked the movement of a Boeing 777 approaching the runway, he smiled to himself and pictured his wife, the woman he loved, the mother of his soon-to-be-born child. How in the world had he gotten so lucky, and what did she possibly see in him?
His supervisor interrupted Rafiq’s musings. “We’ve got Qatar 112 on approach, five miles out. They said the air’s choppy. Asking for a smoother descent.”
Rafiq’s fingers danced over the console as he readied the next clearance. “Got that. I’ll ease them in behind Emirates 841.”
Every one of Rafiq’s responses was deliberate and synchronized, like the intricate knots his grandmother wove into her beautiful prayer rugs. If he strained his ears, he could almost hear her humming one of his favorite lullabies. 
At the console beside him, his coworker Javed lowered his headset and rapidly zoomed in on the data block. “My radar must have glitched. Falcon 452 just disappeared off the scope. I’m rebooting now.”
A chill prickled the back of Rafiq’s neck. 
“I’ve got Falcon 452 on my screen,” Rafiq announced, “but it’s off course, banking hard left.” He tapped the radar console, zooming in on the erratic blip.
Static crackled in Rafiq’s ears. “Approach, we’re experiencing control issues. Request vectors and assistance.”
“What in the world is going on?” his supervisor spat.
Every worker began yelling into their microphones or shouting at one another as panic thickened the air like smog. 
Rafiq glanced back at his boss. “Emirates 841’s altitude readings are fluctuating, and I can’t get them on comms.” He tried to sound calm, tried to mask the rising fear and confusion. He was one of the senior controllers here. He had to stay focused.
“Nobody’s responding,” Javed yelled, unmasked terror in his voice.
Rafiq’s fingers flew over his controls. “Qatar 112’s transponder just went silent. Same with Etihad 309. It’s like the whole system just shut down.”
His supervisor grabbed his headset and shouted, “All units hold positions. Maintain visual separation. Revert to non-radar procedures.” 
The ensuing silence was as caustic as a third-degree burn. Nobody was there. Nobody could respond. 
His boss swore then slammed his fist on his desk. “Pull every channel. Get those aircraft back on comms now.”
“Sir.” Rafiq kept his voice deathly calm but strong enough to carry over the chaos of the tower. “We’ve lost all our radar feeds.”
Their supervisor stormed to his console, his breath hot and acidic as he leaned over Rafiq’s shoulder, staring at the empty screens.
“It’s nothing but static,” Rafiq had to concede. “Transponders are dark across the board.” There was no way to see where any of the dozens of airplanes they’d been tracking were or guess where they were heading.
“Get me eyes on the runways!” his supervisor shouted as Javed and several other colleagues sprang up to obey. But Rafiq remained rooted in place, his eyes transfixed on the window.
He knew it by sound. He knew it by sight.
He knew it by the thunderous rumble and the way his bones rattled.
The Emirates 841, headed straight for the tower.
Rafiq heard the screams but didn’t feel the terror he expected. Instead, a strange, peaceful calm settled over him as his supervisor swore again and Javed ducked under the desk. But Rafiq didn’t move. He simply watched.
And then the world was black.  


3. THE SURPLUS

18 hours before the Pruning
“In Psalm 91, the Good Book promises us that ‘whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.’ The psalmist goes on to assure us that the Lord is our refuge and our fortress.”
Rachel loved listening to her friend Dev’s broadcasts on KWJD. She enjoyed the music but even more the encouragement and inspiration she gleaned from the DJ missionary.
“‘You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day,’” Dev recited. The words from the Psalm were familiar to Rachel, but they seemed so much more meaningful here in her car while she listened to Dev’s impassioned recitation.
All too soon, she arrived at her destination, the local food bank where she volunteered once a week. Rachel pulled up beside her supervisor’s ancient station wagon and hurried into the community hall.
The bell on the front door tinkled its greeting.
“Good morning, Miss Cecelia,” Rachel called out as she stomped snow off her boots and unbuttoned her coat. A loud harumph from the back office told her that Miss Cecelia was in. Rachel glanced at the boxes on the floor. They’d gotten several cartons of donations since she’d been here last week. It would be a busy day, and Rachel was thankful for the work to keep her hands busy and her mind occupied.
“Well now,” Miss Cecelia said as she sauntered out of the community hall’s back office. “I half expected you to be late.”
Rachel was puzzled, given her perfect track record of punctuality, but she’d learned even as a young girl in Miss Cecelia’s Sunday school class not to take her grumpy demeanor too seriously.
“You didn’t sleep in?” Miss Cecelia pressed. “Because of the power outage?” She covered her mouth to cough.
Rachel tried not to think of the bad flu virus going around town or Miss Cecelia’s legions of germs and answered, “Oh. I think our power flickered, but we’re up early anyway to get Caleb and Tychicus off to school.” Rachel made it a point to avoid using either of her children’s nicknames while at the food bank, sticking instead to the Biblical originals that Miss Cecelia found slightly less objectionable.
“And your daughter?” Miss Cecelia asked, her lips curving to a frown. Rachel didn’t know if the sour expression was because Miss Cecelia was always rather disagreeable as a rule or if she disliked Yaya in particular.
“Jael’s great.”
“They’re not getting these power outages up there in Fairbanks?”
“Not that she’s mentioned.” Rachel turned around to face the overflowing boxes of pantry items. She always preferred working here when Miss Cecelia was out, but as a retired nurse, the old woman had very little else to do than spend her days managing the food pantry volunteers and pestering anybody who stepped into the community hall. Thankfully, Rachel had known her since she was a little girl in Miss Cecelia’s Sunday school class and was used to her brusque ways.
Miss Cecelia let out a string of coughs, wet throaty sounds that made Rachel wince. “Miss Cecelia, are you getting sick?”
Miss Cecelia raised a finger in the air while she waited for the fit to subside. “Fit as a fiddle. Now.” She turned back toward her office. “I got some paperwork to take care of. Just holler if you need me.”
While KWJD played over the sound system, Rachel set about making room on the shelves for the new arrivals of canned goods and pantry staples in the section of the community hall that had been converted into a food bank. Glennallen wasn’t what you’d call a prosperous community, with jobs scarce and over half the population at least somewhat reliant on hunting and other forms of subsistence living to keep their freezers and bellies full. Rachel enjoyed the work, enjoyed the feeling of usefulness and the monotony that lulled her into a relaxing state of worship as Christian music played in the background.
A few minutes later, the front door burst open and the entrance bell jingled. A gust of wind blew a dusting of fresh snow into the hall, but in spite of the weather, the room grew instantly warmer with her friend Dani’s arrival. 
“Hi, Rachel.” Dani gave her a quick hug and took off her coat.
“Where’s Leo?” Rachel was so used to seeing her friend’s foster baby everywhere she went that Dani looked almost naked without a front pack strapped to her chest.
Dani glanced at the front door, distracted, then turned to Rachel with a question in her eyes. “Huh?”
“Where’s Leo?” she repeated.
Dani turned her focus back to Rachel and answered, “Oh, I dropped him off at the Singhs’ this morning. Priyah’s been wanting more babysitting experience, and Angel’s there to help keep an eye on them both.” She bit her lip and glanced at the door yet again.
“Everything okay?” Rachel asked. “Are you expecting somebody?”
Dani glanced toward the boxes of canned goods, still obviously preoccupied. “Oh, it’s nothing. It’s just … I mean it’s probably nothing. But you know that old guy with the gray hair and white beard?”
Rachel stared at her blankly, as Dani had just described about a third of Glennallen’s residents.
Dani laughed at herself, but there was a nervousness behind the chuckle that Rachel couldn’t ignore. “You know,” she added, “your husband’s friend. He’s got that scar …”
Rachel perked up at the spark of recognition. “Griz?”
Dani flushed at his name. “Yeah, that’s it. I can never remember what folks around here call him. He was on the side of the road this morning, just staring off into the mountains. It was right at the top of the hill, just after the curve. I came this close to hitting him.”
“Oh.” Rachel knew that many people around town treated Griz with thinly veiled suspicion. She probably would have too if it hadn’t been for the ties that connected him to her family.
“It was so cold out,” Dani went on, “and he wasn’t wearing reflective gear or anything. I’m not even sure he had a hat. And he was just standing there, staring at the sky.”
Rachel wasn’t all that surprised by Dani’s reaction. Most people around town didn’t understand Griz and his hermit-like ways. 
“He’s a tracker,” Rachel explained, trying to stand up for this man who meant more to her family than most of Glennallen realized. “He might have found something interesting to follow.”
“I don’t know.” Dani’s voice grew distant. “I even rolled my window down to make sure he was okay. It’s so cold out I couldn’t just leave someone on the side of the road, you know. And then he looked at me, and his eye …”
She didn’t have to finish her sentence. Rachel was keenly aware of Griz’s appearance and the effect it had on others. She also knew better than perhaps anyone beside Griz himself how his injury came to be, the story behind that brutal scar across his face.
“Anyway.” Dani shook her head as if to clear her mind. “I was a wreck even before I left the house this morning. I had a meeting scheduled with Leo’s care team in Anchorage, and it wasn’t until the social worker texted me I realized the clocks on both my microwave and oven were behind. So I was late to that, and then once I finally got connected my internet kept cutting in and out and we had to keep restarting.”
“I’m sorry.” Rachel hated how spotty the power could be out here, especially in winter. It wasn’t just an inconvenience, but it made it nearly impossible for people like Dani to make telehealth appointments or for Rachel, who relied on stable internet connections for her part-time graphic design work. 
“Any news about Leo or his case?”
Dani shook her head. “Not at the moment. They keep saying the adoption is still on track, but everything is moving as fast as a glacier. At this rate, he’ll be ready to start school before anything gets finalized.”
 Rachel knew her friend was exaggerating, if only slightly, but she couldn’t even begin to guess at the bureaucratic hoops and emotional roller coaster involved in adopting a baby through the state. The fact that Dani was doing it as a single woman barely out of her twenties was even more impressive. Rachel made a mental note to raise her friend up to the very top of her prayer list.
“The social worker and everyone involved in the case are all based in Anchorage,” Dani continued, “and they act like Glennallen is the bush. Now they want me to submit a contingency plan and explain what I’ll do in a power outage. They’re worried about the heat going off and me not being able to find Leo a warm place to stay.”
“Come to our place,” Rachel said. “We’ve got a wood stove, so at least the main level stays warm. You and Leo are always welcome. That reminds me, we ended up with way more formula than the pregnancy center needs over Sanctity of Life Sunday, so if Leo isn’t fussy about the brand, you’re welcome to pop over any time and take it off our hands. It’s just sitting in the basement getting in the way.”
Rachel was surprised when her friend wiped away a tear from the corner of her eye. “That would be a huge blessing,” Dani gushed. “This morning, I was just so stressed I was telling God I don’t know if I can do this without any outside help.”
“You can’t.” Rachel smiled gently. “That’s what we’re here for. Tell you what, next time the power goes out, you and Leo make your way over to our place. I can heat you up some tea on the wood stove, and we’ll enjoy a nice long visit.”
“Thanks.” Dani sniffled and knelt over a box of canned food.
Outside, the wind howled, rattling through the leaks in the community hall windows. The women had only been working for a few minutes when the overhead lights flickered then died.
Rachel had to laugh at the timing. “Well, maybe God wants us to have that cup of tea sooner rather than later.”
“Remind me why we live out here in the middle of nowhere?” Dani asked with a chuckle.
Rachel smiled and gave her friend a gentle squeeze. “Because there’s no more beautiful place on God’s green earth than right here, so we take it, power outages and terrible weather and all.”
“Amen to that,” Dani agreed, and the two women continued working in the dim morning light while they waited for the electricity to turn itself back on.

National Defense Management Center, Moscow, Russia
Pruning Day
Colonel Dmitri Volkov rubbed his eyes then caught the momentary reflection of his face on the command screen in the dimly lit operations center. He was getting too old for this job.
He glowered at his screen. “Darn it.”
“What’s wrong?” asked his new hire, a perky young officer with a long blonde braid that cascaded down her back.
“It’s this stupid system,” he told her. “It’s jammed up in a self-diagnostic loop again.”
Natalia leaned over behind him, so close he could smell her perfume. If he was younger, the proximity might have sent an electric shock zinging through his entire body, but instead he regarded her in the same way he might a granddaughter or favorite niece.
“Should I call the General?” Natalia asked. 
Dmitri waved his hand dismissively. “Don’t bother Petrov. We’ll get it sorted.”
“But protocol …” Her protest died on her lips.
“I’ll run the security check myself,” Dmitri assured her, but her anxious posture didn’t relax until he added, “If that doesn’t clear it up, I’ll notify Petrov myself.”
Natalia returned to her station. A nice girl. A hard worker. Conscientious. A chronic rule follower. And a pretty little thing, too. The kind of girl his son might have won over if he weren’t such a lazy, free-loading …
Dmitri’s thoughts were interrupted by a flashing light overhead. A shrieking klaxon wailed, ear-piercing and forlorn, as if the entire system were in mortal agony.
“What’s that?” Natalia’s face paled. 
In spite of what he was hearing, he wished to reassure her, tell her this was some kind of drill or an overzealous system alerting the center to phantom threats.
But he didn’t have time to make up a convincing lie before Major General Petrov burst in. “What in the world is going on?” he bellowed.
Beside him, Dmitri felt Natalia visibly withdraw a few inches into herself.
“Our entire system’s stuck in a diagnostic loop,” Dmitri explained, hoping that by keeping his voice steady he could lend some of his fabricated calm to his young colleague. “I just restarted the program.”
Natalia pointed a shaky finger at her console. “What’s this mean?” Her question hardly carried over the wail of alarms.
Dmitri stared at the single word that now flashed on her screen.
“Leviathan,” he read out loud. “What the …”
But Petrov was in no mood for deciphering cryptic codes. 
“Security breach,” he barked. “Initiate emergency protocols.”
Natalia glanced toward Dmitri as if she needed his approval. He gave her a single nod, and she spun her chair around to the operations system, fingers flying over her keyboard.
“It’s rejecting the manual override.” Her voice trembled with terror. An ominous foreboding had crept over Dmitri’s weathered bones and now seeped into his veins.
Above them, the flashing siren continued to pulsate and the shrill alarm blared. 
“Somebody better tell me what’s happening!” General Petrov yelled.
Natalia shivered as Dmitri cleared his throat and responded, “Sir, we’ve lost complete control of the command interface. I can try to get it back online, but it’s gonna …”
“Dmitri?”
He stopped midsentence. Natalia’s face was as pale as her hair, but her voice was steady when she told them both, “Someone just activated a missile battery.”
Petrov shoved Dmitri out of the way. “That’s impossible. Who?”
“The system’s acting on its own,” she whispered.
The Major’s eyes narrowed. “Abort. Now.”
“I’m trying,” Natalia insisted, “but the interface is completely frozen.”
“Where are the missiles heading?” the General demanded.
The only sound Natalia made was a small whimper.
Dmitri could see the truth written plainly on her screen and answered for her. “One’s en route to the Kremlin, Sir. It’ll be there in four minutes. Two more for the Ministry of Defense Headquarters and the Lubyanka Building. And the closest one …”
Natalia turned to face him. She knew what was coming just as well as he did, but there was a flash of hopefulness in her eyes, and Dmitri could see she either hadn’t made the calculations yet or refused to believe them. The poor child was still infected with that enviable optimism that blinded the young, that made her believe there might be time for escape. He gave her a slight shake of his head, his heart wrenching into shards at the way her entire demeanor collapsed, her hopes dashed, her youth destroyed by his single gesture.
“Well?” the General demanded.
Dmitri let his eyes linger on young Natalia, a girl with such a promising career and glorious future ahead of her.
Until today.
“There’s also one heading here,” Dmitri told him. “Straight toward us.”
 


4. SACRED PLACES

17 hours before the Pruning
“Ugh, I’m so serious right now.” Yaya sunk into her seat in the student union and took a sip of her cappuccino. “If I have to respond to one more discussion post for this stupid seminar I’m going to stab my eyes out.” She wasn’t sure if this headache was from her dumb assignment or not enough caffeine.
“Oh, come on,” her friend Lilly teased. “You’re just salty because you’d rather be working with Professor McHottie down at the GI. Am I right?”
Yaya wouldn’t even dignify that with a response. It wasn’t her fault that her academic advisor at the Geophysical Institute was the youngest tenured professor on the UAF campus, or that Boone had asked Yaya to help him with his research. She hoped her expression remained passingly neutral and was thankful when Lilly changed subjects. 
“Besides,” Lilly said, “you know you love that architectural history seminar.” She turned to her boyfriend Kai, who was bending over his phone. “What was it, just last week we had to listen to her go on and on and on about how fascinating that mosque-turned-church-turned-museum was? What was its name again? The Haggard Maria?”
“The Hagia Sophia,” Yaya corrected, “and it is fascinating, if for no other reason that it shows how religion’s been used to control the masses.”
Lilly rolled her eyes and nudged Kai in the ribs. “Listen to her. Not even a full year removed from her restrictive evangelical parents, and she’s already radicalized.”
The last thing Yaya wanted to do was listen to her friends poke fun at her family. “Oh, never mind. Did you see the lights out last night?” she asked, more than ready to change the subject.
“Yeah,” Kai answered, still transfixed on his phone.
“Well, don’t sound so excited,” Yaya joked.
He shrugged. “I’m not. You know this is like the tenth or eleventh night in a row they’ve come out. Decades ago, that kind of frequency was unheard of, but we’ve messed up the ionosphere so much lately that our sky is literally glowing to try to get us to wake up and listen.”
Yaya hadn’t meant to get Kai onto one of his environmental tirades, but it was still better than hearing her friends insult her family and her religious upbringing. Even if she didn’t claim her old beliefs, she would rather take a selfie in her swimsuit in the middle of a blizzard than sit back while her friends berated her family.
During the lull in the discussion, Yaya let her mind wander to the weekend. Tomorrow she had a structural engineering lab to complete, and on Sunday Boone wanted her help to test his newest design in one of the Geophysical Institute’s simulations. Which meant that tonight was perfectly free.
“Hey, you guys wanna watch that new zombie movie later on?”
Kai remained fixated on his phone, and Lilly seemed distracted by something else. She squinted her eyes then leaned in and whispered dramatically, “What’s that noise?”
“What noise?” Yaya asked.
“That humming. Can’t you hear it?”
At the look of urgency on her friend’s face, Yaya strained her ears. Even Kai put down his phone and tilted his head to the side. “I think so,” he said after a moment, his expression as serious as Lilly’s.
“There’s nothing there.” Yaya waved her hand dismissively. “You’re just gaslighting me. I’m not falling for it.”
She was about to leave for her last class of the week when Lilly grabbed her arm. “I’m serious,” she hissed. “You almost feel it more than you hear it, like a vibration in the air. Wrr-rrr-rrr.” She made a sound as if trying to mimic the phenomenon.
Yaya shook her throbbing head. She certainly didn’t hear or feel anything. “You guys are crazy.”
Lilly just shrugged. “It’s gone now, but I swear there was something.”
“If you say so.” Yaya slung her backpack over her shoulder. “Anyway, I’ve got to get to class.”
“Well, have fun studying the Haggard Maria and dreaming about your hot professor.” Lilly’s chuckle echoed discordantly in Yaya’s ears as she made her way out of the student union and into the cold.

Hagia Sophia. Istanbul, Turkey
Pruning Day
“My editor hates when I use cliches, but I don’t know what else to say other than I can’t believe I’m actually here.” As strange as she felt speaking into her camera, as if she were a social media influencer in her twenties, Miranda allowed herself to savor this moment as hundreds of likes and hearts and comments from her followers flooded into her livestream. Bracing herself against the biting February wind, she spun around to let her camera catch a panorama view of her surroundings — the wide-open courtyard teeming with tourists, the beautiful stone fountains, the domed marvel of the Hagia Sophia with its minarets stretching up to the heavens. 
“And really,” she said into her lapel mic, clutching her silk scarf with one hand so it wouldn’t flap so hard in the breeze, “I want to start out by just thanking God for making this a possibility. This is such a dream come true for me, and When Morning Dawns wouldn’t have ever taken off the way it did without his blessing. One million copies in less than a year. It’s still so hard to wrap my mind around it. But since we’re here, I want to make sure to answer as many of your questions as I can.”
She squinted at the screen, wondering why they had to make the fonts on these phones so microscopic. “Okay, first question: BookWise99 wants to know how the idea for Ana’s story came about.”
She’d been asked this question a thousand times already, but today she didn’t begrudge it, not here, standing in front of the place where the story truly began. 
“Well, my granddaughter was working on a history assignment, and I just happened to overhear this documentary she was watching about when the city of Constantinople fell to the Turks. And they mentioned something briefly about the very last church service ever held here the night before the city fell, but it was all names and dates, and I was just thinking to myself, this is a desperate gathering of Christians the last night before war. They know their city’s going to fall — the Emperor, the noblemen, all the way down to the lonely commoners like Ana and her family — they all knew what was coming at dawn. And I remember really bristling at the way they were teaching the history of this place through such a shallow lens. I mean, if you’re going to teach me about the very last Divine Liturgy at the Hagia Sophia, don’t tell me what the Emperor wore or what words the clergy would have recited. Tell me about the tears of the mothers clutching their children who wouldn’t live to see another sunset. Tell me about the desperate cries of these everyday people who were taking part in the very last Christian service to ever be held in this hallowed space.”
Miranda wiped at the small tears forming in the corner of her eyes, tears that had nothing to do with the winter chill whipping against her face. 
“I still get worked up about this, because listening to the history, understanding what was going to happen to all those people, to this place of worship, to the entire history of Christianity, I was just so overwhelmed. And that day while my granddaughter was studying, right in the center of my kitchen, this beautiful little Greek girl with green eyes appeared in my mind out of nowhere and she just said to me, Do you want to know what it was like that night? Because I was there. And I can tell you. And that’s how God bestowed upon me the honor to research and write Ana’s story, which was truly one of the most amazing blessings of my entire writing career.”
Miranda let out her breath, surprised that after so many interviews about When Morning Dawns since its breakout success she could still get so emotional. 
She leaned forward to glance at the newest comments on her screen. “Oh,” she said with a chuckle, “BrainyBookworm wants to know if there’s going to be a sequel.” 
A few months ago, the question would have made her so nervous she would have completely skipped over it, but now that the bidding war was over, she could let out her breath.
“At the end of When Morning Dawns, I deliberately left it up to the reader to guess what might happen to Ana. Obviously, I wasn’t going to make you fall in love with this sweet little thirteen-year-old girl just to see her murdered on the last page or anything like that, and when I wrote my first draft, I really felt like Ana’s story was complete and there wasn’t anything more to tell. 
“Then my agent called me just a week or so after the book came out, and she tells me, Everybody’s demanding to know what happens to Ana. I was reluctant to even explore that question at first, because like I said, I ended Ana’s story the way I did for a reason. So even though I can’t promise you that Ana’s family survived the siege and even though I definitely can’t talk about future books that may or may not be in the works, I can tell you that there’s a very specific reason I’m here visiting Turkey, and if it’s any indication as to what I’m doing here, I can also tell you that I brought with me no fewer than five research notebooks, the kind I feverishly fill in when I’m starting to outline a new project.” She winked at the camera as hundreds of hearts exploded on her feed. 
Miranda took a few more questions then ended the livestream. More than anything, she was ready to get out of the cold. 
“Excuse me?” A tall woman with a thick French accent came up to her. “Sorry to interrupt, but I believe you are an author, yes? This is you?” She held up her phone, which was pulled up to the Amazon sales page for When Morning Dawns, and pointed at Miranda’s smiling photograph in the about the author section.
As surprisingly popular as her book had become, Miranda had never been recognized like this outside of writers’ conferences. She had no idea what she was supposed to do other than smile inanely. 
Thankfully, the French woman seemed content to carry the conversation. “I’m actually here today because I read your book and was so touched by Ana’s story. And I decided to come see this place you wrote about so elegantly in your novel.”
“Oh, how kind of you to say.” Miranda was always better online than in person. Should she ask this stranger what she liked about her novel, or was that grossly presumptuous? Instead, she just muttered, “What’s your name?”
“I’m Jaqueline.” 
Miranda wrapped her jacket more tightly around her and said, “Well, Jaqueline, it was great to meet you.”
Before she could walk away, the woman held up her hand. “May I get a picture with you, please? It would mean a lot.”
Miranda smiled. “Of course.” She leaned in while Jaqueline reached out her long arm to click a photo on her cell. The woman’s framing was superb, and the dome of the Hagia Sophia rose up behind them in the background. 
“You look so lovely here with that colorful scarf,” Jaqueline observed. “Would you like me to take a picture of you on your phone and you can share it with your readers?”
Miranda pulled her cell out of her pocket. “Sure, that would be great. Thank you so much.”
Even though she never knew what to do with her arms or hands when she got her photo taken, Miranda tried to look natural. The wind whipped against her hair, and she did her best to angle herself so it wouldn’t whip across her whole face and ruin the picture.
“Now smile.” Jaqueline’s voice was cut off by a thunderous explosion. Miranda ducked, her body reacting faster than her conscious brain could.
Terrorists. Miranda tried to make herself as small as possible. She glanced ahead, blinking while her eyes tried to acknowledge the devastation: Jaqueline’s long legs, wrapped up in a black wool skirt. Her red coat, bright against the overcast sky. And that horrible, terrifying, gaping chasm where her arms should have been. 
The woman took one shuddering step backward before falling lifeless on the ground.
Miranda fumbled as she tried to run toward her and then realized whatever happened wasn’t an isolated event. Screams and shrieks and blood, so much blood, mingled with the smell of burning. A few people were running. Most were injured or motionless like the tourist at her feet.
“It was the cell phones,” somebody yelled. “They all went off at once.”
Miranda glanced around. How could something like this have happened? Her agent had assured her Turkey was safe.
Do something. She had to help. Check on the wounded. Comfort that scared little boy who was crying for his mother. Get herself out of this battlefield.
But she couldn’t move.
Dear God, have mercy on all of us. Bile and that day’s lunch rushed into her throat.
She stood paralyzed until a horrible roar sounded from overhead. A huge plane, with no landing wheels or any indication of slowing down, was headed straight toward the cathedral.
Do something. This time she forced her body to obey. God, help me, her soul screamed as she raced toward the crying child ahead of her, snatched him up in her arms, and started to sprint. 
She had no idea if she could outrun an airplane, but heaven knew she had to try.  


5. WAY OF THE ARTIST

16 hours before the Pruning
Tic spun his pencil in between his fingers to try to keep himself awake in Mrs. Bell’s science class. The narrator on the YouTube video they were watching sounded like an 85-year-old British man who might drop to sleep any second. 
“When particles from the sun reach Earth, they collide with gases in the ionosphere. This creates light, and that’s what forms the aurora.”
While the video droned on, his friend AJ poked his shoulder. Tic was ready for any interruption, even better if it came from her.
AJ leaned toward him and whispered, “Hey, did you see the lights out last night?”
Tic turned around in his seat. “Nah, I was asleep. Were they pretty good?”
She gave a thoughtful pout. “Just weird. Like they weren’t the same kind of green as normal. And you’d see it for a second, then it’d be gone. It was really strange.”
“Strange,” Tic repeated.
The image on the screen flickered for a moment, then disappeared completely as the overhead lights all snapped off at once.
“Power’s out,” Tic yelled, and the class cheered.
While Mrs. Bell tried to keep order, AJ scooted her desk closer to Tic’s. She was always so easy to talk to. While they chatted, he flipped to a blank page in his notebook and started doodling. A power outage in the winter could last for half a minute or half a day. The longest one Tic could remember was three days when he was younger, but never right in the middle of school like this. But for right now, it didn’t really matter. There were only ten minutes left in class, so either the electricity would come back on and they’d finish their incredibly boring movie, or they’d kill time until they got dismissed for lunch. 
As long as the power came back on by woodshop at the end of the day and stayed on for basketball practice, Tic was content. Especially now that AJ’s desk was pressed right up against his.
“Here, let me use your colored pencils.” She picked up a light purple and started doodling on her science worksheet.
Gradually, Tic’s brain tuned out more and more of the classroom cacophony as he focused on his drawing. By the time he’d filled the page with vibrant teals and greens splashed against a midnight blue, the entire school may as well have been empty except for him and his sketchpad. As if driven by some inexplicable force within, he worked at a feverish pace, ignoring the cramp in his hand and the girl at his side as he added depth and layer and color to the picture.
Tic’s dad often got into the zone lifting weights. His mom could lose track of entire hours when she was doing a graphic design project for a client. For Tic, that sense of timeless flow came at stolen moments like this as he sat here, frantically trying to create, desperately trying to convey something … but what? There was something internal, something within Tic himself, that was desperate to come out on the page. As hard as he tried, as close as he might get when he was lucky, he never could fully release this burden that weighed so heavily on his soul. 
Sometimes he feared what would happen if he never found the ability to unleash this passion or this art or this burning within.
Other times, he feared what would happen if he did.
“Whoa. Is that the one-eyed dude who lives up the mountain?”
AJ’s question snapped Tic out of his reverie and he stared at the page.
The northern lights, more menacing than majestic, streaked against the sky like a torn curtain reaching down from heaven to earth. Below was an arctic forest, with an eerie green glow emanating from the trees. And right in the center of the forest, even though Tic had no recollection of drawing him, was the unmistakable figure of his father’s friend Griz, a hermit who most of the town feared, a mysterious man surrounded by rumors and legend.
A man Tic only saw once or twice a year, whose sightings in Glennallen became fodder for gossip for days or even weeks.
A man who was single-handedly responsible for Tic’s very life.

B Train, Manhattan-Bound, New York City, United States
Pruning Day
Although Avram had been riding these same tracks for over eight decades, he always experienced that inimitable sense of awe and wonder when his train burst into the open air to cross the Manhattan Bridge. The city sprawled ahead of him, magnificent monuments testifying to the achievements of man, while soft clouds sprinkled with hints of pink held watch over the early Saturday commuters.
His wife Doris had always reveled in the view of the city, but Avram loved the sunrise.
He let out a contented breath, thankful for the Lord’s grace and favor on this beautiful morning. Thankful that he still had his health. Of course, he’d grown deaf in both ears, walked with a cane (more like shuffled, really), and his hands trembled so hard he could no longer turn the pages of his worn Bible. In spite of everything, he was blessed. His eyes could still take in the beautiful sights of the city. He could sit here on this subway train and worship the Lord with his whole heart. 
He could meet his brother-in-law Jeff for a cup of weak coffee and a few games of chess, a Shabbat ritual that was one of his favorite parts of his week. Ever since his darling wife had gone home to be with her Savior, Jeff was the only other one of Avram’s relatives who also worshiped Jesus Christ as Messiah. Their friendship and love for one another ran deeper than family or tradition or even blood.
The commute was long but peaceful. Even though he wasn’t at church or in a synagogue, he reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out his yarmulke. This train might be a little dirty, a little rundown, and a far cry from what most would consider holy, but for Avram, it was a sanctuary.
By the time the train crossed into Manhattan and resumed its underground course, he was deep in prayer. Thanking God for those forty-one glorious years he’d shared with Doris by his side, the one true love of his life and the one who first introduced him to Christ. Rejoicing that he had been raised in a family that cherished and honored the Scriptures, even though his Messianic conversion had caused cracks to splinter through the previously solid foundation of his tight-knit community.
He prayed for his relatives to come to a saving faith as he had. He prayed for the president and the nation of Israel and for world leaders to be blessed with wisdom and discernment. He prayed for his neighbor, a young widow who’d been struggling ever since her son took a new job and relocated to the West Coast. 
And when he felt all prayed out, he turned his attention to the other passengers riding in his car beside him. 
For the group of college-aged girls, still dressed up from a Friday night out, he prayed for safety and health and assurance of God’s love. For the businessman in an expensive suit gesturing wildly while he yelled into his phone, he prayed for grace and calm and salvation. While the train sped along, Avram lifted a blessing for each individual, from the mother in a hijab comforting a fussy toddler to the waitress holding a cup from one of those fancy coffee places he was always too confused by to order from. The world had changed so much that now even ordering a simple cup of coffee required a master’s degree or some kind of fancy app. Avram wasn’t even certain what an app was. He just knew it had something to do with folks’ cells. 
Avram patted his pocket, where he carried the smartphone he had no idea how to use. He traveled with it because his daughter was afraid he’d fall and break his hip again and not be able to call anyone for help. Truth be told, Avram figured the cell radiation was a greater danger than a hypothetical fall, but he loved his daughter and didn’t want her to worry. Now his focus shifted to the family he and Doris had raised and the children and grandchildren Avram could never keep track of. Still, he prayed for each and every one of them, by name when he could recall it and by thought alone when he couldn’t.
He was so invested in his prayers that it took him some time to react when the lights in the car flickered then dimmed, and bodies lurched forward when the train suddenly stopped. Well, if the subway was running late, that must mean that God wanted Avram to take more time to pray. 
Maybe there was someone here Avram hadn’t fully interceded for. Lord, show me who it is.
But his prayer was cut short when everything happened at once: A burst of light, a concussive force, then the businessman with the headset slumped over in his seat, blood splattering on the window beside him. The college students throwing their purses away from them as if they contained venomous snakes. The horrified gesticulation of the young mother as she desperately swatted at a flame dancing on her hijab.
And smoke. So much smoke.
He couldn’t hear the screams of his fellow passengers but felt their panic. They were underground, trapped in the dark. Was there a fire extinguisher? Sprinklers? He had to call for help. He reached for the phone in his pants pocket, and that’s when he felt the blood. That’s when he realized that his hip, replaced over a decade ago by a skilled young surgeon, wasn’t a hip anymore but a horrible, gaping hole.
Heat spilled from his extremities, or at least what was left of them. Avram’s last thought was that if this truly was his time to go, he was more than ready to meet his Savior and once more see his beloved Doris face to face.
 


6. A MOTHER’S SOUL

15 hours before the Pruning
Rachel sensed something wrong the moment she stepped into her home.
“Cammy?” Usually her dog was waiting for her by the arctic entrance, tail stump wagging wildly, ready to jump up in an enthusiastic and affectionate greeting.
“Cammy?” she called out again, her pulse rising. 
She followed the sound of a little whine from the living room, concerned when she saw Cammy lying by the stove pawing her ear.
“Aw, what’s wrong, baby? Is it another infection?” Rachel knelt next to her dog but didn’t notice anything obviously wrong. She rubbed Cammy’s ears gently and spoke soothing words. 
“Come on, baby,” she finally said. “Do you wanna go outside?” 
At the magic word, Cammy seemed to forget her earache and bounded to the entryway, but when Rachel opened the front door, Cammy let out another whimper, this one louder as if she were in pain.
“What is it, sweet thing?” When no amount of coaxing would get Cammy outside, Rachel shut the door right as her phone started to ring.
Warmth flooded her in spite of the cold when she saw the name on her screen. “Hi, Yaya. How’s my baby girl?”
Her daughter’s eyeroll was practically audible. “I’m fine, Mom.”
Rachel made sure Cammy was situated and comfortable on her doggy bed by the wood heater and went to heat up the tea kettle. 
“How were your classes this week? Everything go okay?” She wished Yaya would tell her more about her studies, but usually all she got were complaints about how many assignments she had to complete or how grueling her schedule was. The only time Yaya seemed excited about school was when she was talking about that advisor of hers, which often sent Rachel’s mother’s heart worrying in an entirely different direction.
After a typical non-committal answer from her daughter, Rachel tried to think of anything that might prompt more than monosyllabic responses. “Oh, did you hear back yet about that summer internship?”
“They won’t announce it before spring,” Yaya began, then her voice grew more animated as she added, “but Boone told me the interns would get a free subscription to Prismatix.”
Rachel didn’t love that her daughter was on a first-name basis with her professor. According to Google, this Boone she always talked about was still quite young, one of those child prodigies who earned his first degree before being old enough to drive a car. He’d made quite a few waves in tech, started and sold some crypto business Rachel could only pretend to understand, and now was at the university researching the intersection between AI and architecture, whatever that meant.
“Which one’s Prismatix exactly?” Rachel asked, guessing by her daughter’s tone she’d caught onto something to keep the conversation going.
“It’s that new design tool I told you and Dad about. You basically tell it what you want to build and the AI comes up with all the schematics and then you just go through and tell it what you want to revise.”
Rachel let out a little chuckle. “Well, don’t let your dad know about the AI side of it. You know how he feels about that.”
Yaya hardly seemed to hear her as she went on talking about this new software. “It’s like ten grand just for the program itself, then you’ve got to subscribe for all the upgrades and stuff, but the interns will get the entire thing paid for. It’s basically down to me and like one or two other students. Nobody else is taking it seriously.”
“Is your project coming along well?” Rachel didn’t exactly know all the details of what Yaya had to accomplish to land this summer position, but she loved hearing the enthusiasm in her voice.
“Yeah, it’s cool. But anyway …” Her tone shifted, and Rachel knew from experience exactly what was coming next. “I was wondering if you could unlock my emergency card? I’ve had this really bad headache all week and need to get some Ibuprofen from the school store.”
A dozen thoughts raced through Rachel’s mind. Why hadn’t Yaya mentioned a headache when they talked a few days ago? Had she taken her temperature? Was she sick?
And why did she need to use her emergency card anyway, a card which by definition was for emergencies, not over-the-counters? What about the spending allowance Rachel wired to her daughter’s account every month? Was Yaya wasting so much of it on fancy coffees at the student union she couldn’t afford to buy herself a cheap bottle of pills?
“Mom?” Yaya asked, and at the sound of her daughter’s voice, Rachel crumpled.
“Yeah, that’s fine. I’ll unlock it for you as soon as we get off the phone.”
“Thanks, Mom! You’re the best.” Happiness and gratitude bubbled over in Yaya’s tone, and Rachel decided that was reward enough even though she and Caleb certainly weren’t swimming in extra cash. She’d inherited her childhood home when her father died, and with it the second mortgage he’d taken out to pay for her late mother’s medical bills. With Caleb’s salary as a teacher and Rachel’s part-time design work from home, they were never destitute, but far removed from that magic fantasy world where you could stop worrying about money. Thankfully Yaya had earned scholarships, which were paying for the bulk of her tuition. Maybe if getting a 4.0 and near-perfect SAT scores meant the Winters didn’t have to shell out tens of thousands of dollars for her education, Rachel could be gracious and not begrudge her a few extra bucks here and there.
She was going to ask Yaya more about her headaches, but the call had already ended. That was strange. Rachel and her daughter never hung up before saying “I love you.” 
She tapped the phone to call Yaya back, but the line was dead. 

Labor & Delivery Ward, Eastside Mercy Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio
Pruning Day
Shaunice held onto the young woman’s hand. “I know you can do this, Kayla. I know it.”
“I need that epidural now,” Kayla grunted, her voice strained.
“Shh.” Shaunice looked at the clock again. “Our anesthesiologist knows you’re here. He knows you’re ready for him. He just needs to finish up what he’s doing, and then he’ll be right in to take care of you.”
“Nobody ever said it would hurt this much.” 
Shaunice had tended to every kind of mother in every kind of situation in the labor and delivery ward. Some women came with their partners and best friends and mothers and sisters and maybe an aunt or grandma thrown in for good measure. Some women came in with a doula (or two) and a birth plan that was five pages long (or ten).
Some women came in terrified or woefully unprepared. Some women came in as calm as a hundred-pound Newfie on the hottest day of the summer. Shaunice was here to help all of them. In her career, she’d tended to deliveries of twins, triplets, and preemies. Had held onto the hands of mothers ranging from far too young to far too old.
She’d been at this job long enough that some of the babies she’d help birth had given birth to their own by now.
And still it was the moms like Kayla that always broke her heart. Too young. Too unprepared. And most of all, too alone.
“You sure you don’t want me to call your mama?” Shaunice asked. The girl was nineteen and didn’t need a parent here for legal purposes. But for moral support …
Kayla shook her head vigorously. “If it’s gonna feel this bad the whole time, there’s no way I’m getting through it,” Kayla complained.
Shaunice handed her a few more ice chips. No use telling her now it would get much worse. Bless her soul, the child was barely dilated to five centimeters. Instead, Shaunice gave her one of her well-practiced pep talks. “Well, now, you know girls like you have been delivering babies since time began. And your body knows what to do. Just like riding a bike, even if you’ve never done it before. Now I’m gonna step outside to ask about that epidural, but I’ll be back to take care of you real soon, you hear me?” 
Kayla nodded her head, and Shaunice’s heart broke at the idea of leaving this child alone even for a few minutes. 
“Now I won’t be long, but you know how to call for help if you need it, right?”
“Yeah.” Kayla’s voice was weak and shaky. The poor thing wasn’t even to transition labor yet and was already showing signs of exhaustion. The best thing Shaunice could do for her was pray the anesthesiologist got here fast to offer this terrified child some relief.
Shaunice kept her voice steady and her face as impassive as possible when she asked, “Anything else you need before I pop out?”
“Can you hand me my phone? It’s over there in my purse.”
“’Course I can do that, honey.” Hopefully, Kayla would use it to call her mom or her baby’s father or anybody to come and be with her.
Shaunice rummaged through the purse on the side table. “I don’t see any phone in here.”
Kayla squeezed her eyes shut and didn’t answer. Shaunice didn’t need the monitor to tell her it was a big contraction. When it subsided, Kayla let out a prolonged sigh. “I might have left it in the bathroom?”
Shaunice had to untangle her leg from the purse strap and the IV line. Halfway to the bathroom, she was almost knocked over by a concussive explosion that left her ears ringing.
“What was that?” Kayla shrieked. The fluorescent lights overhead flickered then died, along with the omnipresent hum of medical equipment and electronics.
“You stay there,” Shaunice demanded, as if Kayla could go anywhere with that IV in her arm. She rushed into the hall to see a dozen or more faces as confused and terrified as she felt. 
“What happened?” Shaunice asked the head nurse.
“I have no idea,” Brenda told her. “We’ve lost power, and a couple cell phones have discharged or something. They just exploded.”
“When’s the generator kicking on?” she demanded.
“It should have already.”
The smell of smoke wafted through the hall. Shaunice waited for the wail of a fire alarm or the icy-cold spray of the sprinklers, but nothing happened.
“We gotta shut those fire doors.” Brenda was already racing toward the exits, and Shaunice ran back to Kayla’s room. No matter what, right now her primary responsibility was to her patient.
“I’m back, baby,” she said, forgetting any pretense of professionalism. “And I know you’re wondering what happened, but I’m not entirely sure yet. What I do know …” She stopped herself and stared at the bathroom, specifically at the smoke billowing out from the bottom of the closed door.
She was thankful that Kayla seemed to be more horrified by her newest contraction than anything else. Good. Shaunice’s one job was to make sure Kayla delivered a healthy baby. And Shaunice knew how to do her job.
“All right, baby,” she began again. “Kayla, I need you to do something for me.” She studied the rollable bed, then thought about the elevators, the smoke, and the four flights of stairs between them and the exits. She had no idea if the entire hospital was in as bad a shape as her ward, and frankly she couldn’t afford to care.
Resisting her instinct to rush, she carefully removed the IV from Kayla’s forearm but kept the port in place so that as soon as everything went back to normal, the doctor could get easy access to a vein. She spotted her patient’s shoes and started putting them on Kayla’s feet.
The physical touch seemed to shock her patient’s focus away from her most recent contraction. “What are you doing?” Kayla yelped.
“Baby, I know this isn’t ideal, but sometimes you’ve got to improvise. We’ve had a …” She paused for a moment, making sure her well-intentioned lie of omission at least sounded plausible. “We’ve had an issue with the power, so we’re just gonna get you to another room.”
“Why do I need my shoes? Shouldn’t I use a wheelchair or something?”
She was so young. So young and scared. Was there anything more vulnerable than a woman in the middle of labor?  Thank God she wasn’t in the pushing stage. Thank God she hadn’t gotten her epidural already, or Shaunice might be carrying her out of here like a sack of potatoes.
“Baby, I’m gonna level with you right now, so I need you to look at me and listen real careful. The power’s out, and that’s no good. We’re gonna need to get you to another section of the hospital, but the elevators won’t be running if the electricity’s out. Now I know it sounds hard, but you’re gonna walk and I’m gonna hold onto you, and we’ll take it nice and slow, and you’re gonna be just fine. Doctors like telling their mamas in labor to walk a little bit if you can. It helps get your hips and pelvis in the right position. It’s good for the baby, too.”
Kayla shook her head frantically. “I can’t.”
“’Course you can, because I’m gonna help you. Now, you just hold onto me like this.”
“I’m gonna fall.”
“You’re not gonna fall, baby, because I got you. I promise to you right now, we’re gonna get you somewhere safe, and we’re gonna take care of you so you can have this beautiful baby and start your new life as a happy, proud mama. Now tell me, have you settled on a name for your sweet thing yet?”
Shaunice couldn’t make out Kayla’s reply, but she decided to keep up her monologue anyway. “All right, baby. So your job right now is to let me help you down this hallway, that’s right, just like that. And we’re gonna find you a bed and we’re gonna tuck you in all nice and safe, and you’re gonna have this healthy little baby in your arms at just the right time, and it’s all gonna be worth it, you’ll see. And then, just imagine, will your precious little one have a story to tell everyone about the day they were born and how much their mama went through just to keep them safe. You stick with me and I’ll take care of you and your baby both. I promise.”
In the hallway, nurses like Shaunice supported their hobbling patients, family members clutched their loved ones, and a few staff members tended to people with injuries.
“Don’t worry about anything else that’s going on,” Shaunice coaxed, ignoring the smell of smoke that grew stronger the closer they got to the exits. She thought about the stairs and wondered if she’d end up carrying Kayla down them one at a time. Well, if that’s what it took …
“You stay with me, baby,” she repeated, “and everything is going to be just fine.”
 


7. HISTORY’S SIREN

12 hours before the Pruning
“Mr. Winters, isn’t it time to go home?” Junior asked.
Caleb glanced at the clock on his desk. “No, these clocks are off because of the power outage. You’ve got to use the big one on the wall.”
Caleb had been nursing a headache since second period. Fridays were always fairly chaotic, but throw in a two-hour power outage, and the middle school felt like a volcano about to burst into chaos at any moment. 
“Mr. Winters,” another student called out, “what’s that weird buzzing noise?”
Caleb had noticed it too — a low, distant drone like an army of giant mosquitoes under the earth — and thought that it also might have something to do with his headache. “I’m not sure,” he answered. “I think it might be the generators trying to kick in or something.”
“But the power’s already back on.”
Caleb shrugged. Who knew why the electric grid out here did what it did? Every winter, their town would experience multiple power outages. And lately, any digital clock you plugged in would start running late after a couple days, as if Glennallen existed on a slightly different version of time than everybody else in the world.
“Mr. Winters,” Junior asked, “what are you doing this weekend?”
The question served as an invitation for twenty eager preteens to chatter all at once, throwing questions at Caleb and each other. Caleb closed his laptop and his history notes. With just a few minutes left in the day, there wasn’t any reason to try to force any more learning.
“Hear ye! Hear ye!” His booming voice split through the cacophony of the classroom, and a chorus of twenty voices echoed back their expected response: “Hark, he speaks.” 
“Good.” Caleb reverted to his normal tone. “Now that I’ve got your attention, we’ll continue talking about Alaska’s involvement in the Cold War on Monday. In fact, I’ve got a video we’re going to watch about a sleeper agent who moved up to Fairbanks. Does anybody know what a sleeper agent is?”
“You mean like a spy?” Junior asked. In addition to being a class clown and one of Caleb’s most promising students, he was the kind of kid Caleb called a wanderer and still hadn’t taken his seat since he came up to ask about the time.
Caleb smiled. It wasn’t always easy to get middle schoolers excited about US history, but he knew this topic would do the trick if anything could. “All right,” he continued. “In a few minutes, I’m going to let you go out to the hall so you can get your winter gear from your lockers before the bell rings.” He glanced around the room, waiting for the comment he knew was about to come.
After only the slightest half-second, Junior’s hand shot up. “Wait, Mr. Winters, did you forget it’s Friday?”
At the mention of the word, all eyes turned to Caleb, who was already pulling up the Friday Rap on his phone. What had started as a joke his first year teaching had quickly turned into a weekly school ritual. While his students hip-hopped and bounced around the room, Caleb joined in with more enthusiasm than anybody else, thanking God for his life, his job, and his students.

USS Ronald Reagan, Mediterranean Sea
Pruning Day
Lieutenant Commander Mack Alvarez adjusted his headset, frowning at the persistent hum pulsating through the audio. The Combat Information Center buzzed with its usual activity, but an uneasy feeling had settled at the base of his gut.
If Mack didn’t have a better word to describe it, he might have called it dread.
“Commander, you getting that feedback?” Ramirez asked, tapping his own headset.
“Yeah.” Mack removed his earpiece and looked at the offending device. When he replaced it, the hum had grown even louder.
“Run a diagnostic on the comms system,” he told Ramirez. “Might be a problem with the new satellite uplink.”
The CIC was Mack’s domain — over two decades in the Navy had earned him that position — and he had no plans to let even the smallest deviation from protocol go unchecked. He paused at his station, overlooking the nerve center of the USS Ronald Reagan, flagship of Carrier Strike Group Nine. This particular naval fleet was in charge of monitoring the sea, air, and land around the Mediterranean. The ships carried powerful weapons ready to protect America and her allies at a moment’s notice, or to simply deter potential threats by their presence.
Through the windows of the command deck, the Mediterranean stretched blue and endless, majestic in its untamed vastness on this mild afternoon. The view reminded Mack of everything he loved about the open waters, everything he loved about the Navy.
“Sir, we’ve got anomalies on the radar,” Wilson called from his position at tactical. “Phantom contacts keep appearing then disappearing.”
Mack strode to the station, leaning over the lieutenant commander’s shoulder. The radar screen flickered, as multiple blips appeared out of nowhere, vanished without a trace, then flooded the screen again.
Well, that didn’t make any sense. “Electronic interference?” Mack suggested, rubbing the back of his neck with a workworn hand.
“I already ran a full systems check,” Wilson told him. “Everything seems to be functioning normally.”
The hum in Mack’s ears intensified. His jaw ached, as if the vibrations were rattling his skull and trying to shake his teeth out of place.
“Commander,” the tactical actions officer called out, his voice uncharacteristically strained. “Navigation keeps jumbling our coordinates.”
Mack crossed to the main display where the ship’s position jumped erratically across the map. One moment it showed their position off the coast of Sicily, the next made it appear as if their entire strike group had inexplicably transported itself into the heart of Paris.
“Could be GPS spoofing,” Mack offered. Intel suggested that the Russians were testing new electronic warfare capabilities in the region. Before anyone could respond, a shrill alarm blared throughout the CIC.
“Commander!” Ramirez shouted, panic now obvious in his voice. “The weapon system just activated, but I swear I didn’t touch anything.”
“Override,” Mack shouted, his calm finally giving way to the panic that had been building up inside him like a breached submarine taking on water.
“I’m trying!” Ramirez pounded on his control panel with both fists. “I’m completely locked out.”
It didn’t matter how or why this was happening. As long as they made it stop.
“Kill power to the launch systems!” Mack ordered.
“They just deployed,” Ramirez exclaimed. “Every last one of them.”
Mack’s blood ran cold as dozens of launch trajectories appeared on his screen—Tomahawks, SM-6s, every offensive weapon in the fleet headed for various European cities.
He reached for the secure line to EUCOM. He had to alert NATO command.
Dead. Not even a ring tone or busy signal. Just that horrible, blasted hum.
He hoped to God it was something wrong with his monitors, that his fleet hadn’t actually launched their entire arsenal of weapons straight at their allies. But his wishful thinking couldn’t erase what was clear when he looked out the window. Trails arcing from all the nearby vessels, streaking smoke across the sky on a collision course for Europe. 
How had any of this happened?
And how many millions would die if he didn’t find a way to stop it?
The deck shuddered with concussive force, knocking him off his feet. Was there a problem with the reactor, or had one of their weapons turned on his own ship? 
The CIC plunged into chaos as smoke billowed up around them. Sailors scrambled, shouting orders at each other as the Reagan began to list.
There was an abandon-ship order that Mack barely heard and refused to obey. He had to stop those missiles. Struggling to right himself as the CIC took on ice-cold water, he grabbed onto the console, praying he wasn’t too late, certain he already was.
The display screen was locked, blank except for a single word: 
Leviathan.
A violent shudder that could have been the ship or his own panic. A scream from deep within the chasms of his very soul.
And then nothing but the cold, relentless sea.
 


8. THE HUM OF TRUTH 

11 hours before the Pruning
Exhausted after a long week of teaching and a Friday-afternoon staff meeting, Caleb braced himself against the biting wind as he hurried to his truck. He’d have to pick up Tic from basketball practice before long, but his afternoon visits to the Christian radio station had become something of a weekly, if not quite daily, occurrence.
Pulling up in front of the KWJD building, Caleb already felt the stress of his day lifting off his shoulders like mist rising from a frozen creek. When he stepped into the office, the sound of his best friend’s broadcast over the sound system greeted him warmly as Dev soliloquized from the sound booth.
“In John chapter 8, Jesus tells us plainly, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’” 
Dev spotted Caleb walking in and waved. Caleb poured himself a cup of coffee from the office pot, refusing to think of how old it might be, and sat down outside the recording studio and watched Dev gesticulating while he preached to an empty, soundproof room.
“This passage reminds us that no matter how dark the world gets, no matter how evil things appear, that Jesus Christ himself, the risen Son of God, is the one true light of the world, and if we walk with him, we will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life. I don’t know about you, but I want to walk in the light of life. I want to walk with my Savior each and every day he gives me on this beautiful, glorious earth he’s created.”
Caleb would never tire of listening to Dev’s Bible teachings. His friend’s slight Indian accent was always a comforting balm at the end of a hectic workday. 
Dev cut to a commercial break and stepped out of the booth, a smile brightening his entire countenance.
“Hey, brother. Great to see you.” He slapped Caleb on the back and clasped his forearm. 
“It’s a little early for Dev’s Devos, isn’t it? I thought you always aired at five.” Caleb glanced at the time, wondering if the radio station’s clock was faulty like so many others around town.
Dev chuckled. “No, my friend. I just got so excited I had to share that verse when I read it. I hope somebody who needed to hear it today was blessed.”
“I’m sure they were. Did you guys stay on air with the power out earlier?”
“We went dark for exactly four seconds before the backup system kicked in,” Dev answered with a proud gleam in his eye. 
“So, I guess all that new equipment from the faith drive was a good investment?”
“Sure was. We’re prepared for winds, fire, power outages, you name it. The Valdez earthquake in ’64? It wouldn’t have touched us. I’m telling you, when God promised to provide for us, he really provided.”
“Amen, brother.” 
“How’s the family?” Dev asked. 
“Just trying to avoid this flu going around. We had a dozen kids out sick today.”
“That’s why we homeschool,” Dev said with a grin.
“I’ll keep that in mind if we ever have any more children,” Caleb joked. The two men chatted for a bit longer until it was time for Dev to go back on air. With a promise to get together for a family dinner soon, Caleb was halfway to the exit when the lights flickered and shut off. In the office, the worship song that had been playing skipped for a half a beat then picked up right where it was.
“See what I’m talking about?” Dev called out as the lights flashed back on. “That backup system is a gift from the Lord God Almighty himself. The devil can try with all his might, but nothing will stop this station from singing God’s praise and declaring his glory.”

10 hours before the Pruning
“No matter how lonely or discouraged you might feel today, the Lord is with you and has promised that he will never leave you nor forsake you.”
Dev’s five o’clock Bible study had been a staple of Rachel’s spiritual life ever since the Singhs moved into the Copper River Valley and transformed the local station from one of random Christian songs and community updates to a worshipful, God-honoring 24-hour-a-day broadcast that blessed the people in and around Glennallen and soothed Rachel’s aching soul.
“God knows your worries, and he wants you to take those worries to him and lay them at his feet,” Dev said. “That means you, whether you’re anxious about your friends or your family or your loved one, or you’re anxious about that prodigal who won’t come home.” 
As Rachel stirred her pot of chicken soup, she wondered how it was that Dev seemed to always know exactly what word of encouragement she needed to hear.
Or maybe it wasn’t Dev at all.
The front door opened, and Cammy let out a happy yip as Caleb and Tic came bursting through the arctic entrance, bringing in a blast of cold air with them. The wind was ominous tonight, rattling the entire house like a wolf shaking the life out of its prey.
“Hey, you’re back.” Rachel greeted her husband with a kiss and forced Tic into one of those side hugs that were getting more and more awkward the taller he grew. “How was school?” she asked.
She couldn’t hear their answers over Cammy’s exultant barking at the KWJD broadcast, so she turned the radio down and asked Tic to get Cammy her dinner. As soon as she said the word, Cammy spun in two happy circles then raced to her spot in the living room to wait for her meal.
“How was work?” Rachel asked, giving her husband a quick hug.
“Good,” Caleb answered. “Power went out here too, I assume?”
“Yeah, a couple hours this morning then it’s been flickering on and off ever since. I made soup with that leftover chicken in case I ended up having to cook over the wood stove.”
“You could have always turned on the generator,” Caleb responded wryly. He could never understand how Rachel would literally sit in the dark for hours, waiting to see if the power would come back on, when they had a generator just outside that took all of two minutes to turn on.
“I was going to,” Rachel told him, “but the snow wasn’t cleared.”
Caleb glared at his son, but there was a softness in his tone when he said, “How many times do I have to tell you not to forget to make a pathway to the generator when you go out to shovel?”
“I’m sorry.” Tic plopped himself down at the table.
“Wash your hands,” Rachel snapped, surprised her sixteen-year-old still needed reminding. What kind of barbarian sits at the table with public-school hands?
Caleb shook his head. “That kid. If I ever find out who his parents are …” He kissed the top of Rachel’s head then sat down at the table. She watched him with a love that felt as cozy as chocolate milk on Christmas morning, with a love that felt solid and familiar. Just like their home.
“How was it at school with the power off?” she asked. Cammy, now fed, was running from one family member to another demanding love and attention before she made her way to the dining room table to beg.
“The kids were antsy. We ended up taking everybody into the gym for an extra-long PE.”
“The whole middle school?”
“Yeah, and halfway through the fifth grade came and joined us, too.”
“Wow, sounds …” Rachel paused, searching for the right word, but all she could settle on was “loud.”
Caleb chuckled. “You can say that again.”
After Rachel brought the soup to the table, Caleb prayed for the food and they all dished up.
“Did you hear Dev’s Devos tonight on the way home?” Rachel asked. “It was really good.”
Caleb wiped his mouth with his napkin, which Cammy tried to eat as soon as he placed it back down on his lap. “No, we missed it. What was it about?”
Rachel tried to remember. She could tell her husband how Dev’s teaching made her feel, how it brought comfort to her heart, but she couldn’t tell him what Dev actually said or even what passage from the Bible he’d been reading.
During dinner, Tic told the family about the chess board he finished in woodshop, the five-on-five basketball tournament the village hall was hosting next week, and the plans he and some friends from youth group were making for a camping trip over spring break.
“It’s going to be so cold, though.” Rachel knew she wasn’t supposed to worry about her kids, but telling her to stop would be like telling Cammy to stop begging at the table, an activity that was always rewarded with scraps from Tic and often from Caleb as well.
“It’s not until the end of March,” Caleb assured her. “And they’ve all got good gear, right son? Everything’s got to be rated for zero degrees or less.”
“Yeah, we’re set.”
Rachel let out her breath, and for the briefest moment, they were in this same house, except there was no Cammy, and Caleb was a good forty pounds lighter. She was wearing a summer sundress and little Tic was finger-painting with some spaghetti in his highchair and Yaya was daydreaming out loud about becoming an astronaut.
Where had those days gone?
She blinked, and the memory vanished, much like the carrots Tic had dropped into Cammy’s mouth when he thought Rachel wasn’t looking. She loved her family. So much. But everything felt so different now. Yaya was two hundred miles away in one of the coldest cities in the state. Tic was nearly grown, talking about leaving their warm, comforting home and living for a week in a tent.
Caleb took her hand and gave it a squeeze. She looked at him, this man she’d married over half a lifetime ago. Sometimes she marveled at the way God had brought them together. Sometimes she wondered if she really deserved to feel so happy and content when there were so many others in the world stuck in terrible marriages or trapped in dire poverty or suffering extreme illnesses.
She didn’t know why, when her life was so full and rich and fulfilling, she would give in to these spells of almost crippling melancholy. It was almost as if her heart weren’t designed to contain so much love and happiness and sometimes it had to wrench itself out in the center of her chest like a sponge squeezing out excess moisture.
Realizing her husband had spoken to her, Rachel blinked herself back to the dinner table and shook her head. “Sorry, what did you say?”
Caleb simply smiled at her. “I said this dinner is delicious. You never cease to amaze me, you know that?”
“It’s just chicken soup,” she said, feeling a slight flush on her cheeks, but she and her husband both knew he was talking about so much more than that.
The wind howled, and a shiver crept from the base of Rachel’s spine up her entire body. 
Outside, the dark night hummed.

Remote Broadcast Studio, KABC News Affiliate, Los Angeles, California
Pruning Day
There was nothing about the routine that should be unfamiliar to Maria Chen. How many breaking stories had she prepared for just like this, down to the 2:30 a.m. wakeup call and the uncomfortable closeness of the makeup artist exhaling coffee breath on her face?
She’d sat in this exact chair hundreds of times. But never for a scoop like this.
“We need her ready in five,” an assistant called out, her entire demeanor far too perky for the early hour and the scope of this story. Maybe she was like everybody else in America, everybody else in the world, really — enviably naïve, blissfully asleep. 
But in a few minutes Maria was going to wake the world up.
And then they would all have to face the consequences. 
She regarded her reflection in the mirror while the stylist spritzed and shaped her sleek bob.
“There she is.” That familiar voice of Paul Reeds, her old producer and closest thing she had to a friend in this business. He was notorious for being boisterous, even at this ungodly hour. But today he looked serious. Subdued. Like the weight of the entire universe had been hoisted onto his shoulders the second Maria divulged what she had unearthed.
She knew exactly how he felt.
When that dad reached out to her and told her how his son had joined some Alaska-based cult, Maria followed a few leads, thinking she’d have a simple weekend story. Cults were never breaking news, not until people got themselves killed in some kind of shocking massacre, but this was a new take on an old story. A group of techies out in the middle of nowhere Alaska, most of them extremely educated, all of them professing atheists, but undeniably a cult nonetheless. Instead of God, they worshiped some vague notion of a supreme AI entity, and instead of a biblical apocalypse they preached a technological doomsday.
It was supposed to be a moderately interesting cautionary tale: How to react if your child gets caught up in a tech cult, early warning signs to look out for, the usual sort of clickbait drivel. The only reason she followed up with that distraught father in the first place was because Paul had called her off the Project Black story. Said she was too close to it since the senator accused of embezzlement had belonged to her ex-husband’s college fraternity. 
At the time, she’d rolled her eyes. Pretty soon you wouldn’t be able to cover a story if it took place at a destination your aesthetician had once driven through on a first-grade field trip.
But as Maria dove into her research on this Alaska-based cult, she realized there was more behind the Copper Serpents than just some tech-focused doomsday weirdos. And when she followed the vine to find the melon, she was shocked to discover how rotten and poisonous the fruit actually was.
“You good?” Paul asked, snapping her back into right now, just moments before she broke her story on live morning TV. 
“Define good.” She chuckled mirthlessly. 
Paul let out his breath. “I just wanted to make sure you were ready.”
Ready? She thought about everything she’d gone through in the past three months, the looking over her shoulder at every crosswalk and red light, the multiple encryptions on every device she owned, the way she’d aged ten years in so many weeks.
And of course, the threats.
“You know how it’s gonna go,” Paul told her. “Just remember our signal, and the second you say so, we pull the plug. It’s as easy as that.”
Maria pushed aside the mascara brush that was blocking her view, and she leveled her gaze directly at him. “Is it, though? Is it really that easy?” 
Paul had the good sense to look away.
“We need Maria in place,” someone called in. 
Paul reached his arm out as if he were escorting her on a date. “Come on, let me walk you down the hallway.”
She was about to protest, but the sturdiness of his body next to hers gave her a small degree of comfort, and she let him lead her to the studio, the clicking of her heels on the linoleum echoing in her ears like the methodical banging of a judge’s gavel.
Paul handed her a small earpiece as she seated herself in a high-backed chair. A technician lifted his finger. “One minute.”
Her producer held her gaze for a moment longer, and Maria thought about all the other sensational stories they’d broken together. Fentanyl-laced drugs deliberately smuggled into minority neighborhoods with the DEA’s tacit approval … perhaps even direct oversight. Social media conglomerates selling data to foreign governments, including health information gleaned from biometric scans. The rise in youth suicides linked to manipulative algorithms that deliberately destroyed their users’ self-image in order to sell cosmetics or athletic shoes.
At the time, those stories had felt important. Monumental.
Until today.
On the screen in front of her, the video feed from the East Coast went live. She stared straight ahead while a voice in her earpiece counted down.
“Five … four … three …”
“Welcome back.” The New York anchor’s voice was steady and unwavering. “This morning, we’re joined by Maria Chen, award-winning investigative journalist, coming to us live from Los Angeles. She’s here to talk to us about an obscure Alaskan cult, a dire doomsday prediction, and a sweeping scandal reaching from the highest levels of world governments to the most powerful figures in global tech. Maria, thank you for being with us here today.”
Maria’s resolve was strong, and a surprising calm washed over her. This was, after all, her job. Not only that, it was her ethical duty to tell the public how horrifically they’d been deceived. 
She took a deep, steadying breath. But before she could say anything, the screen went black. She glanced at the crew, who all simultaneously began shouting and running and gesturing to each other en masse. 
Her heart started to race. Was the Copper Serpent behind this? Had someone realized what she was about to do and found a way to cut the power to the entire building? 
A deep, growling roar sounded in Maria’s headpiece, soon growing so loud she threw it off with a start. At the same time, a series of explosions rang out through the studio. Instinctively, she jumped off her chair and crouched behind a desk. 
Gunfire?
Peering out, she saw several studio workers on the ground nursing gruesome, bloody wounds.
What in the world?
The droning sound was so loud it shook the entire studio, except this time it wasn’t coming from her earpiece. A horrible, whooshing drone, loud and violent like the roar of an airplane at takeoff, a noise so strong it sounded as if it could rip the building apart.
A bright light. A shrill shriek. A searing pain.
Then nothing. Absolutely nothing.
 


9. A NEW DAWN

4 hours after the Pruning
Rachel woke up to the sound of Cammy whimpering quietly at her feet. “What is it, baby?” she whispered. “Is it your ears again, sweet thing?”
Cammy lifted her head, sauntered over to Rachel’s chest, then lay down, still whining slightly.
Rachel reached out to rub her dog’s ears but paused. Why was the bedroom so cold?
And so quiet?
The clock on the nightstand was blank. Great. Another power outage. Based on how dark it was, it could be midnight, or it could be eight in the morning. The only thing she knew for certain was that it was cold.
Too cold.
She nudged Caleb who was snoring beside her. She hated to wake him up, but with these kinds of temperatures, they couldn’t go very long without heat.
“Hun,” she whispered, “the power’s out.”
Caleb rolled over to look at her. “So?” 
Rachel could never get over how sexy her husband sounded when he first woke up, even when he was obviously annoyed. 
“It’s freezing in here.”
“What time is it?” Caleb reached for his cell phone and moaned.
Cammy looked over at him, one ear perked up in concern.
“What’s wrong?” Rachel asked.
“I plugged my phone in to charge last night, but it’s completely dead.”
“Here, I’ll check mine.” She reached over to her nightstand. Same thing.
“I hate these stupid power outages!” Caleb spat.
Rachel tried to ignore her husband’s outburst. Yes, it was inconvenient. Yes, it could even get dangerous when the temperatures were this far below zero in the middle of winter. But getting angry wasn’t going to warm their home.
“I guess it’s a good thing Dev helped you get the generator working,” she said, hoping her husband would read between the lines of her suggestion. 
“You want me to go out and turn it on now?” There was a hint of incredulity in Caleb’s voice.
“It’s really cold,” she reminded him.
Caleb groaned. “All right. Have I told you I hate this power system?”
Rachel reached her arm out to him. “Once or twice. Now hurry up, and when you get back, I’ll warm you up again.”
Her subtle teasing seemed to soften him. “All right. Do you have a flashlight or something? I’d use my phone, but …”
She reached into her drawer. “Here,” she said. “Take this.”
He flipped on the flashlight, and she gazed at his salt and pepper beard. He’d been clean-shaven when they met. Clean-shaven and so young. They both were. Rachel hadn’t even turned twenty before she knew this was the man she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. 
Power outages and everything.
“I’ll be back,” he told her. “Don’t let Cammy steal my spot.”
Rachel was glad to hear some playfulness back in her husband’s voice. “If anything, she’ll just warm it up for you.”
He flashed her a smile as he threw on some Carhartts. “That’s your job, babe.”

“Remind me again why we live in Glennallen?” 
Caleb wasn’t normally in the habit of talking to himself, not unless he was sleep-deprived, freezing cold, and perturbed. What made everything a hundred times worse was that Tic hadn’t shoveled a path out here like he was supposed to, so with each step Caleb took, ice-cold snow sank over the tops of his boots.
He was really going to have to have a talk with that boy.
Of course, he wouldn’t have to yell at Tic if the stupid electrical grid out here did what it was supposed to do. This was the first time his cell acted up, but if a power surge had fried his phone, the electrical company was going to buy him a new one.
In spite of the cold, Caleb was sweating under his coat when he yanked the pull cord on the generator. Instead of the expected whir, there was only silence. 
No, not exactly silence. That ridiculous humming was back again, surrounding him on every side. Was it louder than it had been yesterday, or was he just more easily annoyed right now?
He stared at the sky, trying to determine where the cursed noise was coming from. That’s when he saw it, the green eerie glow in the distance. It was way too low on the horizon to be an aurora. 
What in the world was going on?
He jerked the pull cord again, expecting that extra bit of exertion his foul mood gave him would get the generator working. In a few minutes, he’d be back in his room, the house would be warmed up in no time, and he and Rachel could enjoy a nice lazy Saturday morning. This was the first weekend all semester when Tic wasn’t traveling for basketball. The entire family had earned themselves a quiet weekend.
Except the generator still wouldn’t start. It wouldn’t even sputter.
“What is going on?” Caleb was aware that his voice was rising, but it didn’t matter. It wasn’t as if anybody out here could hear him arguing with this defunct piece of machinery. With all the time Dev spent last summer helping them get it up and running, Caleb couldn’t believe the stupid thing refused to turn over.
“Come on,” he urged and resisted the temptation to kick the entire unit.
He checked the gas, even though he knew the tank was full. That wasn’t the problem. So what was?
After several more futile attempts, each one making him angrier than the last, his torso was drenched in sweat, his feet and face ached with cold, and he could see the frost forming on his beard. Desperate, he pounded his fist on top of the petulant machine, half hoping to hear that beautiful mechanical whir, but to no avail.
Well, he couldn’t stay out here all night fighting with a stupid piece of equipment. Or maybe it was morning by now. With the power out and his cell phone dead, who knew? 
He reached into his pocket. At least he’d remembered his phone. If it was just the battery, he could plug it into the truck. On cold mornings like this, he liked to let the truck run a little anyway so the oil could still flow. The keys were in the ignition, but when he turned them, nothing happened.
What was going on? He jumped out of the truck and slammed the door shut. That horrid droning rattled inside his ears, but he still couldn’t tell where it was coming from. He lingered for a moment longer, frowning at the horizon, before heading defeated back into his cold, dark house.

***

Rachel was shivering under the blankets when Caleb returned. “Everything okay?” she asked, hoping the generator hadn’t given him too much hassle.
“No,” he replied dryly. “It’s totally dead.”
“Dead?” Her stomach sank. “Did you check the gas tank?”
“Of course I checked the gas tank.” She tried not to bristle at his tone. She knew how upset he got when things in the house stopped working. Repairs were always expensive, but even if you had extra money lying around, it was impossible to get skilled contractors to come all the way out here to fix anything. In order to survive in a remote place like Glennallen, you needed to be a genius with home repairs like Dev, or you needed a skilled best friend who was willing to help you out. 
Like Dev.
“The truck wouldn’t start either,” he grumbled.
Rachel sighed. Sometimes the temperatures would get so cold at night that if the vehicles weren’t plugged in they wouldn’t run. Good news was there wasn’t anywhere they needed to go today.
“Did you check the wall clock?” Rachel asked, hoping to get Caleb’s mind off the immediate problem of having no heat, no phone, no truck, and no generator in the middle of winter.
“Just after six,” he grumbled despondently.
“Wanna try going back to sleep?” She already knew his answer.
“No. We need to call the electric company and see how long this is going to last. They can’t expect us to go days like this with no heat.”
“We’ve got the wood stove,” she reminded him.
“That’s not the point,” Caleb spat. He looked at her face, and his expression softened. “I’m sorry.” He sat on the edge of their bed, his shoulders slumped. “I’m not mad at you, babe. I’m just frustrated and venting. That’s all.”
“I know.” Still, it was hard for her to see her husband so upset, hard for her not to immediately shut down when his anger flared up. After two decades of marriage, she still wasn’t used to it.
“What happened when you restarted your phone?” 
His question caught her off guard. Was she supposed to have read his mind and magically gotten her cell working again? 
“I didn’t try it yet.”
He let out a disgruntled sigh, visibly irritated. This was a common source of strife between them. If something was lost or broken, Rachel was content to wait and see if the problem would work out on its own. Keys would find themselves. Power would turn back on. You didn’t have to stress over small annoyances that in time would correct themselves without your help. 
But sometimes she felt that if she didn’t get anxious or angry at every inconvenience, Caleb assumed she didn’t care. Instead, she simply failed to see the point of getting stressed. Why blindly push buttons on a dead phone? Why call the electric company when the workers there obviously knew the power was out?
“I’ll try restarting it now,” she offered, but he was already fidgeting with his own cell. Cammy, as if trying to make him feel better, gave his hand two gentle, deliberate licks. He gave her a half-hearted push away but didn’t say anything.
There was nothing Rachel could do to ease her husband’s anger, but still she wracked her brain, trying to come up with something.
“You know,” she suggested, “even with the power off, once we get the wood stove up, I can make some of that oatmeal bake for breakfast. I think I can tweak the recipe to make it in a pot instead of a casserole dish.”
“Yay,” Caleb remarked dryly. “Oatmeal.”
Okay, Rachel was done trying to cheer him up or get his mind off their problems. If she knew anything about her husband, she knew that after a few minutes and a mental reset, Caleb would be back to the jolly, joking man she adored. Maybe the power would magically flick back on, and they’d find their phones had just run out of charge somehow in the middle of the night.
Everything would be easier once the sun came up. Tic would bring in more firewood, they’d keep the wood stove burning, and everything would be fine. With all the power fluctuations yesterday, she’d even had the foresight to fill the bathtub, so they’d have water to flush the toilets and wouldn’t literally freeze their butts using the outhouse in the cold.
It was going to be all right. They’d experienced dozens of power outages before. 
Today would be no different.

***

If ever Caleb needed a workout to seize control of his anxious thoughts, it was today.
“Come on, baldy,” Tic teased as Caleb locked out his hips while deadlifting 335 pounds. “Is that the best you got? I could do ten of those for my warmup.”
Caleb groaned as he let the weights crash to the ground. The iron plates hitting the rubber mat gave a satisfying metallic clamor. Caleb sank down on the bench to catch his breath. The basement was cold, far colder than normal, and he liked it.
“Tired already, you puny wuss?” Tic asked.
After the morning he’d already had, there was something comforting about his son’s playful insults. “All right,” Caleb replied, “if you think you’re so big and tough, let’s see what you can do.”
Candlelight flickered across Tic’s smiling face as he added fifty additional pounds and set himself up behind the barbell.
“Okay, keep the bar in contact with your legs, keep your spine neutral and lock out your hips,” Caleb told him, out of habit rather than necessity. In spite of all Tic’s trash talk, when it came time to actually lift, he was extremely careful. There was no way Rachel would trust either of them to push and pull thousands of pounds every day in the basement otherwise.
With a deep, controlled inhale followed by a loud roar, Tic raised 385 pounds of dead weight off the ground and locked it out.
“Nice work, weakling.” Caleb tried to hide his proud beam behind a stoic face as Tic dropped the bar with a grunt.
“You’re just jealous because I’m outlifting you so bad today.”
“You think I can’t match you?” Caleb glanced at the bar and its fifty extra pounds in addition to what he had just repped. “Watch this.” He stood up, knowing his back would regret his decision tomorrow, but the pain would be worth it. 
A day would come, far sooner than Caleb was ready for, when Tic would prove stronger than his father in every measurable way.
But today was not that day.
He’d just gotten himself into position when Rachel’s voice called to them from upstairs. “Breakfast’s ready.”
Caleb stared at the barbell and shrugged. “Guess I’ll have to prove myself another day.”
“Sure, old man, whatever.” Tic, possessed with the boundless energy of a healthy, athletic teen, was already halfway up the stairs.
The main level was toasty from the blazing heat radiating from the wood stove. Rachel had lit several candles around the room, far more than Caleb would have wasted, but the atmosphere was inviting.
“I made us some oatmeal bake,” Rachel said as they found their seats around the table. “Actually, I guess it’s more like oatmeal boil,” she added with a smile. “And we’ve got some canned peaches to go with it, and I heated up some water for pour-over coffee.”
Both Caleb and Tic made simultaneous gagging noises, and Rachel rolled her eyes. “Okay,” she teased, “well, in that case, I’m happy to share some of my tea.”
“No, no, no,” Tic responded jovially. “Pour-over coffee is definitely better than no coffee.”
Caleb wasn’t certain that he shared his son’s sentiment, but he was thankful that his workout in the basement had reset his brain. He still wasn’t happy about the power failing, but he wasn’t ready to kill the world or burn down the electric company. 
“That oatmeal smells good,” he lied to his wife. Caleb never fully understood the point of a breakfast that didn’t consist of eggs, bacon, and preferably another type of meat or three. But he knew he’d been an ogre when Rachel woke him up, and he wanted to make it up to her. 
“All right.” Rachel reached out her hands to her family. “Anything in particular we want to thank God for today?”
“This son of ours managed to hit 385 on his deadlift.” Caleb beamed at his boy. “As much as I like to tease that kid for being a puny little baby, I’m actually quite proud of him.”
Tic rolled his eyes, but Caleb caught the pride shining in his expression.
Rachel gave his hand a squeeze. “I’m thankful that we had some warning yesterday that the power might stay off so I filled up the bathtub. It’ll be nice to have that extra water to …”
Tic interrupted her with a groan. 
“What is it?” she asked.
Tic squeezed his eyes shut, as if he couldn’t bear to watch the words coming out of his mouth. Or maybe he didn’t want to see his parents’ faces as he spoke them. “I drained the tub last night to take a shower and forgot to fill it up again.”
Immediately, Caleb’s stress level, which had never gotten far below a four out of ten, shot up to twenty. Or maybe two hundred. “You did what?” He pulled his hands away from his family.
“I’m sorry.” This time, there was no teasing tone or fake insults when Tic spoke. “I was tired and gross and sweaty after basketball, and I just forgot.”
There wasn’t a single word Caleb could speak right now that he wouldn’t regret. Thankfully, Rachel was ready to jump in. “Well, good news is there’s lots of snow.” She leveled her gaze at their son. “After breakfast, I want you to take one of the big bins from the garage and use that to fill the tub. And in the meantime, I guess we can be thankful for our outhouse.”
“Sorry, Dad,” Tic mumbled, and Rachel put a calming hand on Caleb’s leg.
“That’s all right,” he responded. “It’s not your fault the power’s off.” 
Caleb took his wife’s hand back in his and reached for his son’s with the other. “Well,” he said, “speaking of what we’re thankful for, I’m thankful for my family, and I’m thankful for our wood stove, and I’m thankful for this oatmeal. Now let’s dish up before it gets cold.”

***

While Rachel watched her family seated around the breakfast table, she tried to suppress her uncomfortable sense of foreboding. Something was wrong, and not just with the electricity. 
While Tic and Caleb had been working out downstairs, she’d assessed several things around the house. With every other power outage, she’d been able to get at least a few hours of work done using her laptop’s battery reserve and her mobile hotspot. This morning, neither device turned on at all, even though she always kept both charged. 
The damage seemed to impact other electronics, too. Caleb always insisted their home security system wasn’t necessary in a community like Glennallen, but Rachel felt safer having it. Every other time the electricity turned off, it ran on backup battery power, except this time she couldn’t even get the home screen to start up. 
She kept waiting with held breath. Any minute, the power could turn on, and just like that, their cell phones and electronics might all start working again. Just one of those strange things that happened out here, like the way digital clocks all ran a little slower than they were supposed to, or the way the ceiling fan in the living room would occasionally turn itself on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. Just a symptom of their quirky power grid out in the middle of nowhere.
She sipped her tepid tea and tried not to think about how cut off they were with no phones or internet. It was like back in the homesteading days when people had to rely on telegrams or radio.
That was it. Rachel jumped up out of her seat, startling Cammy, who was licking Tic’s pants leg under the table.
“What’s wrong, babe?” her husband asked.
“I’m trying to remember where that old radio is.” She grabbed a flashlight and hurried to the basement, returning a few minutes later with the small battery-operated machine, praying it would work.
“I need two double-A batteries,” she announced. 
Caleb stepped into the living room and pulled their clock off the wall. 
Rachel shook her head. “Not from there.” That analog clock was the only thing keeping time in their entire house. And until everything started working again, she was going to make sure it stayed ticking.
She pulled the batteries out from the TV remote then clicked the radio on. A rush of relief surged through her when she heard the familiar sound of static. 
“It’s 87.9,” Caleb told her.
She slowly raised her eyes to meet his. “I know,” she said and held up the radio so he could see the dial. It was already tuned into Glennallen’s only station. 
But there was nothing but static.
Caleb and Rachel stood staring at each other, and an entire wordless conversation flashed between them.
It’s probably nothing, Rachel thought. Just a really bad power outage that took out all the cell towers and fried all the electronics. But deep in her heart, she feared there was more to it. And by the look on her husband’s face, she could tell that he feared it, too.
“Mom? Dad?” Tic’s voice sliced into their silent discourse like a surgeon’s scalpel. 
Rachel forced a smile onto her face. “Guess all that fancy equipment Dev bragged so much about wasn’t as all-powerful as he wanted to think.” With deliberate cheer, she headed back to the table. “Come on. I don’t think the oatmeal bake will keep very well, so we better eat what’s left over.”
“Dad?” Tic was looking at his father with an expression that pierced Rachel’s soul like a poisoned arrow.
Caleb put his arm on Tic’s shoulder. “It’s okay, son. Your mom’s right. We may as well eat since there’s not a whole lot we can do until we figure out what’s going on.”
“But what is going on?”
Rachel longed for the days when her little boy would believe each and every word that came out of her mouth. She could tell him Santa Claus wouldn’t bring presents unless he was asleep, and he wouldn’t question her. She could tell him there was a man who lived on the moon and fished for shooting stars and disappeared once a month to go to Saturn to buy bleu cheese, and he’d ask her what his name was.
More than anything, she wanted to believe this was another normal power outage. After breakfast, they could clear the table and bring in a few more candles and play Scrabble or Risk as if nothing was out of the ordinary. She wanted to find some honest way to communicate this hope to her family, but before she could respond, Cammy yipped and raced to the door.
Someone pounded frantically on their front door. “Caleb? Rachel? Are you in there?” 


10. VISITED

Tic wasn’t a baby, and in spite of all his father’s good-natured nicknames, he wasn’t an idiot either.
When he finally demanded answers from his parents, he was half afraid they’d assure him everything would be okay and then go back to worrying like they had all morning. But instead, their conversation was cut short by the arrival of Tic’s best friend Benji and his family.
“Dev’s been out all morning,” Mrs. Singh explained. “He’s trying to get the station up and running again. We’re out of heat at home, and he thought it best we come over here.” 
“Of course.” Mom gestured to the living room, where the wood stove crackled in the corner. “Here, let me get some water heated up, and we can make you some tea.”
Benji’s little sister scurried to the couch.
“Hi, Priyah,” Tic called out. She didn’t answer but buried her bright-red face in a backpack full of gadgets.
Next to enter was Tic’s best friend, Benji. They greeted each other with their usual multi-step handshake, but their movements were stilted and habitual. Even their goofy hip bump at the end felt forced. “Wanna go upstairs?” Tic asked.
“It’s freezing up there,” Mom protested before Benji could answer. “Don’t you want to stay here by the fire?”
“It’s way too hot,” Tic complained. “Look, I’m dripping in sweat.” He held up his arm to show his mom the pit stain on his T-shirt. Priyah giggled quietly in the corner, and Mom feigned disgust.
“What are you gonna do upstairs, anyway?” she prodded.
Tic shrugged. “I dunno. Play guitar or something.”
“Isn’t it electric?” 
“It works without the amp,” he told her, trying not to roll his eyes. “It’s just quieter.” He turned back to Benji. “Come on.”
“Cool. Where should I put my helmet?”
Mom reached out her hand. “Give it to me and I’ll hang it up in the arctic entrance. Did you guys snow machine over here?” she asked Benji’s mom.
“Yeah,” Mrs. Singh answered. “We couldn’t get the van running.”
That got Tic’s attention, and he held off from racing upstairs long enough to listen in.
Mom seemed just as fixated on the news. “Caleb’s truck wouldn’t start either, but it’s not that cold out, is it?” 
Mrs. Singh shook her head then lowered her voice. “I don’t think it’s the cold.”
“Little Miss Genius is convinced it’s an EMP.” Benji’s voice was taunting.
Priyah looked up and glared at her brother. “I said it might be.”
Mrs. Singh looked sharply at both of her children. “Both of you cut that out,” she warned. “We don’t know what’s going on, and there’s no use speculating.”
Benji shrugged. “If you ask Priyah, it’s either a cyberterrorist attack or a solar storm.” 
Tic was actually relieved that someone — even Benji’s pathologically shy little sister — was actually trying to explain what was happening. He moved toward the couch where Priyah was tinkering with her bag of electronics. 
“A solar storm,” he prodded. “If that’s what’s doing all this, will it all go back to normal once it ends?” He felt stupid that a middle-school student could understand the science better than he did, but Priyah was basically a homeschooled genius. If she was the only one willing to talk about what might be causing all the electronics everywhere to crash, he was determined to listen.
Her hands were shaking a little as she tried to connect two exposed wires. She bit her lip but didn’t respond.
“Eh, don’t bother her,” Benji said. “She’s crazy.” He circled his ear with his finger to drive home the point.
“All right.” In all the time he’d known her, Mrs. Singh had never raised her voice, but right now she sounded tired and exasperated. “Benji, if you’re going to insist on taunting your sister, then go upstairs with Tychicus. It’s either that or you can apologize to her and to our hosts for being so rude.”
Benji’s shoulders slumped. “Sorry,” he muttered then turned to Tic. “Play some guitar?”
Tic lingered at the bottom of the stairs. He wanted to find a way to say something kind to Priyah to make up for her brother’s behavior. 
“Uh, what are you working on there?” 
She either didn’t hear him or pretended not to.
“Priyah found the parts to an old ham radio,” Mrs. Singh explained. “She’s going to put it together and see if we can find out what’s going on out there.”
Tic smiled in her direction, even though she wasn’t looking at him. “Cool, well, good luck with that,” he said then followed Benji upstairs. He’d find another chance to ask Priyah about solar storms. In the meantime, he didn’t really feel like fooling around anymore on his guitar.
“Why are you such a jerk to your sister?” he asked once he and Benji were alone in his room.
Benji shrugged. “I’m not a jerk. But you know what a nerd she can be. Honestly, I think she wants it to be an EMP or something so she can prove that she was right.” Beneath his friend’s blustering surface, Tic detected the same worry and unease that had been swirling around in his gut all morning.
He sprawled out onto his bed. “You really think it might be something serious like that?”
Benji plopped into the oversized recliner. “I dunno. Maybe it’s one of those things where everybody goes crazy and tells you it’s the end of the world and it ends up being nothing?”
Tic chuckled. “Yeah, I think my grandparents were way into Y2K back at the turn of the century. Stockpiled a year’s worth of food and everything.”
Benji shook his head. “That’s what I mean. Everyone was all worked up and nothing came of it.”
Tic leveled his gaze. “So you really think that’s what all this is?”
Benji didn’t answer right away and averted his gaze before mumbling, “Yeah. Of course.”
“Well, that still doesn’t give you an excuse to be so rude to your sister.”
Benji rolled his eyes. “Oh, please. The last person I want to hear you talking about is Priyah.”
“I’m just saying, she’s smarter than you give her credit for.” Tic wasn’t sure why he was defending her all of a sudden. Maybe he was itching to do something, anything, even if that was to pick a stupid fight with his best friend.
“You wanna go on about each other’s sisters? Fine.” Benji’s face was set, and his usual good-natured tone had vanished. “Let’s do it. Let’s talk about Yaya and you see how much you like it when I tell you that she —”
The pillow was in Tic’s hand one second and smacking Benji’s smug face into silence the next.
“What the …” Benji jumped up and glowered down at Tic. He was taller, but Tic was stronger by far.
Slowly and deliberately, Tic stood up and faced him, his muscles ready for action.
For a brief moment, everything was perfectly still, as if the world was frozen in place except for the two of them. Then Benji let out a forced laugh and his face broke into a lopsided grin. “Come on, man. I was just messing with you.” He tossed the pillow at Tic’s chest. Tic rolled his eyes and threw it back on the bed.
They both sat back down, and Benji sighed. “You know I didn’t mean anything about Yaya.”
“Yeah, I know.” 
Benji shook his head. “It’s just so weird with this thing between you and Priyah.”
Tic stared at him, as surprised as if he’d just confessed that he was going to ask the ancient Miss Cecelia to the prom. “What?”
“You know, that big unspoken crush between the two of you.”
Tic couldn’t contain his laughter. “Bro, it’s definitely not like that. I’ve known Priyah since she was in diapers.”
Benji chortled. “She was five when we moved here, moron.”
Tic shrugged. “So? How old are little kids when they stop wearing diapers?”
“You’re such a baby.”
Benji picked up Tic’s guitar and started strumming, and soon the tension faded into the sound of melodies that carried over the hum and the stress of the outside world.

***

Caleb stewed in his recliner in the living room, growing hotter every moment. Whether that was from the wood stove or the stress was anybody’s guess.
“Do you guys have a landline at your place?” Rachel asked Angel Singh, who’d stopped by earlier with her kids to get out of their cold house. 
She smiled sadly. “Yes, but it’s not working.” She lowered her voice. “We’ve had lots of power outages, but I’ve never experienced anything like this. Have you?”
“It is weird,” Rachel agreed, “but you never know. Might just be one of those strange flukes.”
Caleb had heard enough. He wasn’t going to sit around and listen to his wife’s typical “let’s wait and see if things get better on their own” drivel. The last thing he wanted was to sit around here doing nothing. Not with their entire town completely cut off like this. And who knew how bad it was in the rest of the world? Anchorage, Juneau … Fairbanks.
He jumped out of his seat and strode toward the basement door.
“Where are you going?” Rachel demanded. 
“Downstairs,” he answered, slamming the door shut behind him.
In the basement, he cursed himself for forgetting a flashlight. Thankfully, there was enough sunlight coming in from the upper window that he managed to find a battery-operated torch. He stubbed his toe on one of the weights and wanted to scream. Why did Tic always forget to rack his weights after a workout?
That was it. He couldn’t take one more stressor. He needed to do something to put his mind at ease.
He threw open the door to the freezer. They still had several dozen packages of caribou. Even without electricity, it was cool enough down here the meat would last quite a while before thawing. And when that happened, they could always take some of it outside and hope the bears didn’t notice.
One entire freezer shelf contained nothing but Ziploc bags filled with Rachel’s soups and stews. He could think of a hundred other meals he’d prefer to eat, but at least nobody would go hungry.
The pantries were stocked with staples: pasta, spaghetti sauce, those silly granola bars nobody ate but his wife kept buying. They had canned beans, canned corn, and several types of canned fruit. As long as the handheld can opener wasn’t lost or broken, they’d be okay.
Stacked in the little crawl space beneath the basement stairs were boxes of shelf-stable foods Caleb hoped they’d never have to use — freeze-dried camping meals and old MREs as well as bulk bags of rice and dried beans.
What about water? The Winters had a well on their property, but it ran on electricity. A couple years ago, after the last prolonged power outage, Caleb invested in a hand-operated pump he could install outside. They’d have to carry water inside with buckets, but that was certainly better than nothing.
It’d be a pain to operate in this cold, but then again, it’d be a pain to die of dehydration.
Was he overreacting? Caleb had no idea. For all he knew, the entire world may have been obliterated by nukes and only individuals in rural pockets like Glennallen had even survived, in which case he was grossly underreacting.
What he needed was more information. He couldn’t wait around for Priyah to fiddle with that little amateur radio. He stomped upstairs and grabbed his coat and boots. 
“I’m going to find Dev,” he called out to his wife then braced himself against the bitter cold. 

***

“Is he okay?” Angel asked after Caleb slammed the door shut. 
Rachel let out a sigh. The last thing she wanted was for Mrs. Proverbs 31 herself to start judging her husband or her marriage. “Yeah. You know Caleb. He just gets stressed.” 
She didn’t want to talk about her husband’s anxiety. Angel, with her picture-perfect family that might have walked off the cover of a Focus on the Family magazine, could never understand. Besides, there was so much more on Rachel’s mind right now than Caleb’s blood pressure. 
“I think it’s ready.” Priyah had been sitting so quietly on the couch in the corner that it was easy to forget she was there. The young girl glanced up from a clunky metal box with wires trailing from it like vines. Rachel had no doubt that if anybody could get a radio operating under these conditions, it was Priyah. Last year, she and two other local homeschoolers had placed third in a statewide robotics tournament, competing against huge schools from large cities like Anchorage and Fairbanks.
“Did you get it working, sweetie?” Angel asked.
“I think so.” She flipped a switch, and the radio came to life with a burst of static. 
Priyah smiled sheepishly. Rachel held her breath. Even Cammy had stopped dozing by the stove and was staring at them attentively, her head cocked to the side.
Priyah bit her lip and with steady fingers turned one of the dials. A series of tones warbled in and out of focus. Then a succession of quick beeps, followed by more static. 
The speaker sputtered again, and a voice crackled over the waves. A bit more static as Priyah fine-tuned the dial.
“Station … south or west. We’ve lost … Copy?”
Rachel leaned forward, as if she could turn her body into an antenna and improve the signal. “Can you bring him back?”
Priyah continued making adjustments until the voice was crisp and clear.
“This is Buster, station Kilo November Six Mike Alpha, calling from Delta Junction, Alaska. We’ve got complete power failure, no cell, no internet. Cars stopped running. Can anyone copy? Please respond if you’ve got ears on.”
They all waited, staring at the device in Priyah’s shaking hands. 
“You should say something to him,” Angel prodded. Priyah’s eyes grew twice their size and she tossed the transmitter into Angel’s lap like a hot potato. 
“Tok here,” another voice answered back. “This is Kenny Parks, Whiskey Seven Delta Charlie Foxtrot. We’re seeing the same thing here. Whole town’s blacked out, nothing on the grid, vehicles are deadweight. You thinking might be a solar flare?”
“Could be. Or something bigger,” Buster added, his voice lowered. 
“You heard from anybody in Anchorage or Fairbanks?”
At the mention of her daughter’s city, Rachel sucked in her breath as if she’d been punched in the solar plexus. Until now, she’d done her best to stay positive, to think and hope and pray that what they were experiencing in Glennallen would prove to be a short-lived, isolated event, a blip on the radar of their calm and peaceful lives.
There was a pause before Buster spoke again. “Delta Junction calling. Any stations in range? Fairbanks, Anchorage, Juneau … Please respond. We’re trying to find out how far this goes.”
“Should we tell them we’re here?” This time it was Angel asking. Rachel nodded, even though her thoughts were solely on her daughter.
Priyah showed her mother how to hold down the button to talk, and in a shaking voice Angel said, “Hi there, this is Angel.” She cleared her throat. “My daughter got this radio up and working. We’re in Glennallen. We can hear you.”
“Glennallen? You doing okay? Power out there, too?”
“Yeah,” Angel answered, appearing to grow more confident as she spoke. “It’s just like you said. We can’t use the landlines or cells or anything.”
“You mentioned you’re with your daughter. Are you both okay? Is anyone else there?”
Rachel grasped the transmitter without thinking. “Hi, I’m here too. This is Rachel. From Glennallen. My daughter …” Her words came out in frantic, breathless spasms. “My daughter’s in Fairbanks. At the university. She’s staying in the dorms. I don’t know … I haven’t heard …” 
She couldn’t finish. Cammy scurried over and started licking her anywhere she could reach.
There was a pause on the other end. Then the same voice returned, softer this time. “Copy, Rachel. We’re hoping someone from Fairbanks comes on soon.”
“It’s her first year of college. She’s never been on her own before.” Rachel didn’t know why she was explaining Yaya’s life story to a stranger, but she couldn’t stop herself. With a soft whine, Cammy laid her head in her lap.
This time the operator’s voice was more official. “This is Buster in Delta. If there’s anyone in Fairbanks monitoring this frequency, please respond. We’ve got a mother here trying to reach her daughter.”
The radio crackled, then went quiet again.
“What was that?” Rachel asked. Cammy’s ears perked up, and she tilted her head to the side.
“… dark… copy … repeat, if you …”
Rachel froze, not even daring to breathe.
The voice crackled in again. “Repeat, Fairbanks … smoke … unknown …”
Rachel turned to Angel. “Did they say Fairbanks?” Just as quickly, she pounded the talk button with her free hand. “Buster? Did you get that? Did they say Fairbanks? Buster? I couldn’t hear the whole thing.”
Buster’s voice remained calm. “Rachel, we heard something too, but it wasn’t clear enough. Could’ve been Fairbanks, but it was too weak to lock on. Best thing you can do right now is wait.”
She clasped the microphone so tightly she was afraid it might break in her grasp. “What does that mean? Do I just stay here? I don’t know how this works. I just need to know my daughter’s okay.”
“What’s her name, ma’am?”
“Yaya, I mean her full name is Jael. Jael Winters.”
Buster’s voice was calm and stable. “Okay. Jael Winters. And you’re Rachel Winters? From Glennallen?”
“Right.” She could barely talk through the lump in her throat, the flutter in her chest.
“All right, Rachel. Tell me something about your radio. How are you keeping that thing powered right now?”
“It’s a car battery, right?” She looked to Priyah for confirmation. “Yeah, it’s a car battery.”
“Okay, good,” Buster replied. “That should buy you a good amount of transmission time, but you don’t want to waste it either. I’d say power down for now and come back every couple of hours. We’re logging all calls. If we find out what’s happening in Fairbanks or get a message from Jael, we’ll pass that on to you when you check back in.”
Rachel couldn’t answer him but only nodded her head. While Angel stared at her sympathetically and Cammy nuzzled her head into her lap, Rachel clutched the radio as if it were the last strand of hope connecting her mother’s heart to Yaya’s lost soul.
 


11. AFTERMATH

The fact that the sun was rising over Fairbanks seemed like the universe’s biggest insult.
Yaya wasn’t sure if she was in shock or just cold, but she couldn’t stop shaking.
“And I looked over, and bits of her phone were over here, and bits of her were over there.” Lilly hadn’t stopped talking about the exploding cell phone that killed her roommate. But whereas her friend apparently wanted to rehash the incident twenty times over, as if that might purge it from her memory, Yaya needed the exact opposite.
She needed silence, and she needed to forget. Forget the screams, the smell of smoke, the chaos. 
In reality, Lilly was the lucky one. Her roommate had died instantly, not in Yaya’s arms while she tried screaming for help with a voice that couldn’t carry over the shrieks of other students. Eventually, Yaya’s RA ran into her room and told her to evacuate. The cell phone detonations had started a series of fires in the dorms. But how could she leave? Even once the RA confirmed that her roommate wasn’t breathing, he had to pry Yaya away and practically throw her coat and boots over her pajamas.
She didn’t have anything else. No backpack, no purse, no identification. 
And of course, no phone.
All year, students in the freshmen dorm complained that the outlets were too far away from the beds. Yaya kept her phone charging on her desk at night. Her roommate bought an extra-long cable from the campus store so she could scroll herself to sleep. And now look what had happened to her. 
“And I haven’t heard from Kai, either,” Lilly rambled. “I don’t know where he ended up in this mess.”
Yaya cared for her friend too much to speak what was truly on her mind. Kai was never more than an inch away from his cell. With everybody’s phones inexplicably exploding at the same time, the odds certainly weren’t in Kai’s favor.
“Maybe he went with the first group to the library,” Lilly said, more to herself than anyone else.
At first, all the students had been told to congregate in the library, but when it looked as though that was going to have to turn into a triage center, those without any serious injuries were urged to seek shelter in other buildings. The problem was finding one that was unlocked. Yaya had been working so many late nights with Boone in the GI building that her advisor had finally given her a key code, so that’s where she and several others from her floor headed. With the power off, the key code hadn’t worked, but a few students managed to break a window to let them in. 
Now, there were about a dozen others besides Yaya and Lilly huddled in the middle of a lab, and it seemed as if Yaya was the only one who didn’t want to speculate and rehash the terror of the previous night.
“Did anybody manage to call 911?”
“No, none of the phones are working, even the landline in the RA’s office.”
“The fire department’s gotta know the campus is burning, though. Why haven’t they come?
“Fire trucks can’t get here.”
“Why not?”
“You didn’t hear? My buddy was going to drive our friend to the hospital, but nobody’s cars will start. It’s an EMP or something.”
“I heard there might have been a bombing. Do you think that’s what that big boom was?”
“I didn’t hear it. I was asleep till my cell phone blew up.”
“No, the big one came after. The phones all went off, then a few seconds later there was this huge explosion.”
“I didn’t see it.”
“You couldn’t see anything, but I felt it. Thought it was an earthquake.”
“No, earthquakes don’t make noises like that, right?”
“Someone said it might be the base getting attacked.”
“Which one?”
“I dunno. I can never keep them straight anyway.”
“You can see the smoke still. Which direction is that? Is that where Wainwright is?”
“You should stay away from the windows,” Yaya told them.
“She’s right,” Lilly jumped in. “I mean, if cell phones are going off and bombs are exploding, that’s probably not the safest place.”
“If bombs are exploding, then nowhere’s safe.” 
There wasn’t much arguing with that logic. Nevertheless, standing by an open window seemed stupid. So did staying in this lab when there were other structures just down the hallway that would be better suited.
“I think we should go to one of the other rooms,” she told Lilly.
“What? Why? Even if there was some kind of attack, they’d bomb the bases, not here, right?” Fear flashed in Lilly’s eyes.
“What if we check out the seismic lab?” Yaya suggested. “Or even just something more interior without all this glass? Want to come look with me?”
“I don’t know. I think we should probably all stick together, don’t you?”
Yaya glanced around the room at the small cluster of students. No RAs, no security officers, no staff. They were all stragglers from the first-year dorm. Even the oldest among them couldn’t legally buy a beer. Everybody looked shocked, and everybody looked as if they were just waiting for someone else to take charge. 
Certain of her plan, if not of her own confidence, Yaya stood up. “We should see if the seismic lab is unlocked. It’s got insulation and extra supports.” Yaya was slightly surprised when everyone turned to look at her. What didn’t surprise her were the looks of doubt on their faces.
“It’s literally designed to withstand earthquakes and stuff,” she urged. “We’d be a lot safer there.” She turned to Lilly, who simply shrugged and grabbed her coat. Yaya expected maybe two or three at most to follow, but to her surprise every last student filed into the hall.
“So where is this earthquake lab or whatever?” Lilly asked.
Yaya knew the area well. Sometimes if Boone was manning an experiment, he’d move his office hours there. “Down this hall,” she answered, grateful to have Lilly standing beside her.
She wasn’t sure what they’d do if the room was locked, but thankfully the door opened easily.
Eyeing the lab, she immediately felt more convinced of the wisdom behind her plan. The walls were lined with thick acoustic panels, and heavy steel framing cut through the ceiling. Maybe it was just her mind playing tricks on her, but even the floor felt sturdier.
Then she saw the body.
And recognized who it was.
She ran toward the crumpled form of her advisor and knelt by his side, her eyes sweeping over his unconscious body. His shirt was bunched up to reveal a bloody gash on his abdomen.
“Boone?” She was so shocked she couldn’t manage to make her voice louder than a whisper. “Can you hear me? What happened?”
A second later, Lilly was on the ground beside her. “Is that your professor?”
“Yeah,” Yaya answered. “He must have been down here when the phones exploded.”
“What would he have been doing here so late?” Lilly asked.
Yaya didn’t bother explaining about her advisor’s work, the experiments that sometimes required round-the-clock monitoring. None of that mattered. What mattered was tending to Boone’s injuries. His sharp, jagged breaths fueled her resolve. 
She turned to the group of students. “Does anyone have first aid experience?”
“I used to be a lifeguard,” someone said, but his face was so pale Yaya wasn’t sure he could keep himself from fainting, let alone prove to be any help for Boone.
“What do we need to do?” she asked.
“Uh … um … first thing is …”
Lilly moved toward the boy and placed herself between him and the injured professor. “Hey, it’s all right,” she told him. “What’s your name?”
“Zeke.”
“Okay, Zeke,” Yaya called out, thankful that her friend was there keeping his focus away from the blood and mess. “So he’s bleeding right above his hip. If this was your basic first aid class, what would we need to do?”
“Call for help.” Zeke’s answer was met with silence, but Yaya didn’t want to give him too much time to get more flustered.
“Okay, and then what’s next?”
“Uh, we stop the bleeding. If we can. Is it …” He leaned to the side to get a better view then started to sway. Lilly barely caught him and turned him around. 
“Don’t look at him,” Lilly ordered. “Just tell Yaya what he needs.”
“Okay.” Zeke’s voice was starting to sound calmer now. “So, first you need to see if he’s breathing.”
“Yeah, he’s breathing,” Yaya answered. 
“And, um, do you feel his pulse?” 
Yaya put her fingers on Boone’s neck. The skin was cold and clammy, but there was definitely a heartbeat. “Yeah, it’s there, but I don’t really know what I’m looking for.”
“I don’t really either,” Zeke admitted with an embarrassed chuckle. “So, um, if he’s breathing and has a pulse, then we want to see if there’s anything dangerous around him. Like any glass or anything we need to move out of the way.”
“I’ll get these pieces of his phone picked up,” someone volunteered.
“You’re doing great, Zeke. Now what do we do?” Yaya didn’t want to mention the bleeding and make the poor kid pass out, but she had a feeling that tending to Boone’s gaping abdomen was a slightly higher priority than sweeping floors.
Zeke cleared his throat. “So, for his wound, is it like … the blood … does it like … is it …”
Yaya cut him off before he passed out. “It’s not spurting or anything. It looks almost more like bad road rash or something.” She wondered if that was the wrong term to use given Zeke’s present constitution. “It doesn’t look like he’s actively losing a lot of blood right now.” She hoped that was a good sign. 
“Right, next up. So, the thing to do …” His voice faded out, and for a moment Yaya worried he’d faint and hit his head. Then she’d have two patients on her hands, not just one.
“Come here,” Lilly told him. “You better sit down.” She led him to one of the lab stools.
“I found a first-aid kit on the wall,” someone said and handed the large plastic box to Yaya.
Finally. Now they were getting somewhere. “Okay,” she said. “They’ve got some sterile gauze. Should I just put it on the wound?” She addressed the room, assuming Zeke was out of commission for the moment. 
“Do I need to clean it or anything?” She dug through the medical supplies, looking for any type of antiseptic. She found a small single-use pack of antibiotic ointment, but there was no way it’d cover a wound that large. Besides, she couldn’t picture it being healthy to just goop Neosporin on top of an open gash like that.
“You should put a bandage on the area then hold it down with pressure,” a kid with dyed hair said.
“Do you have first-aid experience?” Yaya asked him in relief.
“No,” he answered, “I just watch a lot of YouTube.” 
Yaya had no idea if he was joking or not. Either way, she was more than happy to abdicate her position as Boone’s paramedic if somebody else was more qualified. And by the sound of heaving coming from the other side of the lab, Zeke was done giving medical advice.
The blue-haired student knelt by Yaya and rummaged through the first-aid kit. “So, we should probably use a little of this saline rinse on the area just to make sure it’s clean. Then we’ll put the gauze on, and add some pressure to stop any internal bleeding. You can use these gloves,” he said, handing her a sterile package.
“Do you want to do it?” she asked hopefully.
“I don’t touch blood,” he stated without a hint of irony.
Yaya glanced up at the other students, but none of them stepped forward to volunteer. She took a deep sigh. “Okay. I guess maybe I should wash my hands first?”
The boy shrugged. “Couldn’t hurt.”
Yaya stepped toward the sink in the lab, but of course there was no running water. She wiped her hands with antiseptic from the first-aid kit then wrestled her fingers into the gloves. She wasn’t extremely squeamish, but she didn’t want to do anything that might make Boone worse. Covering his wound with a bandage was one thing, but putting her palms over it and pressing down and … 
She couldn’t think this way anymore. She had to dive in.
She looked down at Boone, remembered how kind he had always been to her, and took a deep breath.
“All right,” she said, “let’s do this.”


***

“All we can do now is pray for Yaya and everybody up in Fairbanks with her.” Some part of Rachel’s brain wanted to respond to Angel’s words, but all her energy was focused on keeping her heart beating, her lungs working, and her entire body from collapsing.
All we can do is pray. Angel’s platitudes, well-meaning though they were, sounded hollow and empty as they rattled around and echoed through Rachel’s soul. All we can do is pray? Had Rachel stopped praying for even a second since her daughter left for school last fall? If a mother’s prayers could protect a child from harm, Yaya was destined to be the most blessed, most protected, most covered young woman on the planet.
Unless everything the Bible said about prayer and faith was a complete lie?
“Priyah, honey,” Angel cooed, “Why don’t you go find something for Mrs. Winters to drink. Maybe check the kettle for some tea or see if there’s something in the fridge.”
If Caleb were here, he wouldn’t want anyone opening the fridge. He’d want to keep it sealed and shut and cool for as long as possible. But Rachel didn’t have the mental capacity to care or the physical energy to tell Priyah she wasn’t thirsty.
A short moment later, Rachel was sipping a mug of weak, tepid tea, not because she was thirsty but because she didn’t want Angel to keep pestering her.
How long since they checked the radio? She needed to learn more about the situation in Fairbanks. But according to the wall clock, only ten minutes had passed since receiving that terrible, cryptic message. It didn’t make sense. She’d been sitting here for hours in her fear and in her worry. 
No, not hours. Days. 
Weeks.
She’d been stewing in her worry since the moment Yaya was born. And now, she had no idea where her daughter was or if she was even …
Cammy’s bark interrupted her thoughts and startled Rachel out of the dark places where her soul had begun to teeter.
“Is that someone outside?” Angel asked.
Rachel couldn’t find the strength to respond but simply shrugged. She knew Angel was trying to be a good friend, but her attention was smothering. Not only that, but it was distracting Rachel from focusing on all the terrible things that might be happening in Fairbanks if the power wasn’t restored. How would the college feed all those hungry college kids? How would they keep them warm and safe? The campus must have some kind of generator, right? But if the generators weren’t working …
And what if nobody’s cars would start up there? All the staff would be at their homes. Who was going to take care of all those kids?
“I’ll go see what’s out there.” Angel stood up.
Cammy started barking even more frantically and let out a high-pitched whine. Rachel turned and saw Angel staring out the window as if a beheaded John the Baptist were on the doorstep.
“Who is it?” Rachel asked, certain that if she stood up she would spot a trooper at her front door, coming to tell her that Yaya was dead.
“It’s that man,” Angel whispered. “The one with the scar. He’s got …”
A blast of cold air chilled the entire house when Griz burst through the front door, carrying a limp body in his arms.
“Dani?” Rachel jumped up.
“I saw her a little over a mile from here,” Griz said, stooping as he came in from the arctic entrance. Rachel and Angel followed him as he carried Dani into the living room, tracking snow and gravel behind him. “Found her in the snow. Lost a lot of heat.” Without waiting for any instruction, he laid her on the couch closest to the fire. He grabbed a throw blanket and wrapped it over her. 
Angel helped him straighten it out, and Rachel immediately examined the unconscious woman. Dani’s face was a pale, bluish gray. Her lips were split and cracked open, with flecks of dried blood around her mouth. 
But that’s not what made her gasp. 
“The baby!” she exclaimed. “Where’s Leo?” 
That’s when she heard the faint cry coming from within Griz’s coat. He unzipped it, revealing Dani’s six-month-old foster baby fastened to his chest with Griz’s suspenders criss-crossed to hold him in place.
Rachel’s entire body flooded with relief. Angel, who possessed more maternal instinct than anybody else Rachel had met in her entire life, rushed forward and took the child from him, feeling his hands and forehead.
“He’s still warm,” she breathed gratefully.
Angel grabbed an old flannel Tic had forgotten on the couch and wrapped him up. 
“Might have got himself a bit jostled when she fell,” Griz said, “but I checked his pupils. They’re dilating just fine.”
“I told her to come here,” Rachel gasped. With the realization came a growing sense of horror. “She was worried about the heat, so I told her the next time the power went out to bring Leo over here …” 
Was Dani’s car amongst the vehicles in town that wouldn’t start? Had she tried to walk and gotten injured on the way? 
The entire scenario was too horrific to fathom. If Dani had started off for Rachel’s first thing in the morning and somehow slipped or gotten injured, she could have been exposed to the elements for hours before Griz found her. How long had she been lying in the snow before she passed out? How long was she calling for help, but with no neighbors nearby and all the cell phones down … 
Rachel bristled when she touched Dani’s cold cheek with the back of her hand. Just yesterday, the two women had been busy working at the pantry, stocking shelves, talking about Leo, and now …
“We need to get her coat off,” Griz ordered. “All that snow and ice is sucking the heat straight out of her core.”
Rachel tried to work Dani’s arm out of its sleeve, but her entire limb was stiff and unyielding, almost as if rigor mortis had set in early. For a second, she had to double-check that her young friend was, in fact, still alive. Dani’s breathing was faint and shallow, but at least it hadn’t stopped.
“Not that way,” Griz snapped, stepping forward. “We’ve got to keep her as still as we can. She’s got a nasty cut on the back of her head. I don’t know what else she hurt.”
“But her coat’s too stiff to move,” Rachel observed, not wanting to mention that Dani herself was, too.
“I know,” Griz said. “We need to cut it off.”
Rachel stared at Dani’s thick North Face coat. Scissors wouldn’t even scratch a seam. She felt completely lost until an idea set in. “Priyah,” she said, turning to the young girl, “go knock on Tic’s door and tell him to bring me up the garden shears from the basement.” 
“What in the world happened?” Angel whispered as she watched her daughter race timidly up the stairs.
“From the looks of it,” Griz explained, “she fell and hit the back of her head on the ice.” 
That’s when Rachel first noticed the blood. She tried not to show her shock. She had to stay composed. Had to help Dani.
“Did something to her ankle too,” Griz continued. “See here? Whatever it was, she couldn’t get up. Based on the marks in the snow, she focused all her attention on keeping the baby warm before she passed out. Made sure he was completely zipped inside her coat. Good quality coat, too,” Griz observed. “Probably saved the little guy’s life.”
Nobody commented on what Griz didn’t say. 
That coat may have saved baby Leo from dying from exposure, but what about Dani?
 


12. CRUMBLING

“Okay, brother, we’ve reached the moment of truth.”
Caleb clenched and unclenched his fists nervously as Dev clamped a wire to the 12-volt battery. 
“It’s not sacrilegious to lay hands on a piece of machinery, is it?” Dev asked. His smile did little to cover up the intensity of the moment. 
For the past half a day, Caleb had been in the KWJD studio helping Dev gather tools to assemble a makeshift shortwave receiver. That way, they could at least tap into some of the emergency frequencies. The transmission system was completely toast in this blackout, meaning the Christian station was off the air indefinitely, at least until some semblance of power and normalcy returned. But if this rigged-up contraption worked, they’d be able to listen in on emergency chatter and hopefully get an idea of what was happening around the state.
Caleb knew his wife would be at home worrying herself sick about Yaya. Caleb had been anxious too, of course, but at least he had this project to keep his mind occupied for the last several hours.
His jaw was clenched as he watched Dev connect the last lead to the 12-volt battery and flip the switch. He held his breath.
Nothing.
“Please, Jesus,” Dev whispered.
He fidgeted once with the antenna tuner, and the dials lit up with that beautiful glow of real, actual electric power. The room was filled with a low persistent hum, as welcome to Caleb’s ears as the very last school bell on a Friday afternoon.
And then, just when Caleb thought there wasn’t a sweeter sound on this side of heaven, came the beautiful, garbled crackle of static. The rig was working.
Caleb was so elated he may have started whooping and hollering, or perhaps stripping down to his underwear and dancing like David before the Ark of the Lord. But Dev was still complexly absorbed in his work, his back hunched over and face set as he tuned the dials with a steady hand. 
“Okay,” he announced casually, as if completely unaware of this miraculous technological achievement. “I’m gonna look for one of the HF bands they use for emergencies.”
The needle on the signal strength meter warbled for just a moment, then shifted as if clicking into place. Caleb was certain his blood pressure was skyrocketing with anticipation, then a faint voice came through the speakers.
“This is K7AJS in Palmer.” The voice crackled with static, and both Caleb and Dev leaned forward toward the receiver. “We have relay from FEMA Alaska and scattered contact from the Lower 48. Widespread infrastructure failure confirmed.”
Caleb’s heart stopped in his chest. Time held still.
“Statewide power grid is down. Cellular networks are offline. Vehicles impaired. Assume full systems collapse. Repeat: No cell service. No Wi-Fi. No functional grid power.”
For the first time, Dev was without anything to occupy his hands, and the color drained from his face in degrees.
The transmission crackled, and Caleb worried they’d lost it, but then the voice returned. “Fairbanks reports widespread instances of phones and portable devices exploding. Casualties reported.”
Caleb felt Dev’s gaze turn to him, but he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the receiver.
“Explosions confirmed at Fort Wainwright and Eielson Air Force Base. Origin of the attack unknown. Multiple fires reported throughout the city. Emergency vehicles are unable to respond. Extent of damage and number of survivors unknown.”
“Are you okay, brother?” Caleb could barely register Dev’s words.
“Is this the same frequency Priyah’s trying to connect to with her ham radio?” He spat out the question but rushed out the door before waiting for an answer. 
He had to get home. 
He had to reach Rachel before she heard this transmission.

***

Caleb jogged the entire way home, even as his lungs burst from the cold and exertion and his huge, clunky bunny boots might as well have been two cement flippers. 
He burst into his front door, his only thought that the news from Fairbanks would destroy Rachel, and he had to be the one to tell her.
But when he saw her silently weeping next to Angel on the couch, with Tic and the Singh kids looking shell-shocked and forlorn beside them, he knew he was too late.
“Rachel,” he breathed, and she looked up at him with an expression more pained than any painting of any Madonna in the entirety of art history.
He rushed to her. “Babe, I’m so sorry. We’ll do everything we can to get her help. We’ll figure it out. You’ll see.”
“It’s too late,” Rachel sniffed. “She’s already gone.”
The words hit Caleb with the force of an avalanche. He always trusted in his wife’s intuition, and had seen it proven right on multiple occasions, but this …
No, he refused to accept that. 
“She’s not,” he coaxed, begging with all his soul to get through to his wife, pleading with all his might that this was the one time in their entire marriage that her gift of discernment was wrong. “She’s not,” he repeated, trying to make his voice sound stronger. More convincing. 
Rachel had to be mistaken. Surely God wouldn’t …
“She died just a few minutes ago.” Rachel let out a stifled sob, and that’s when Caleb’s tunnel vision began to clear up enough that he noticed others in the room as well. 
A baby in Angel’s arms. Griz standing in the center of the room. And a woman on the couch.
A woman he knew.
Oh, no.
“Is that …” He didn’t want to complete the sentence.
Griz took a step forward. “She fell in the snow. We did what we could.” He lowered his gaze and shook his head.
Caleb had never experienced the type of emotional whiplash he was experiencing right now. First Fairbanks, then rushing home to Rachel. 
And now Dani? A young mother on his couch … Dead? And her foster son …
“The baby’s okay?” Caleb asked, reaching out to the infant in Angel’s arms. 
Leo squirmed in his hands and reached to grab his beard. Babies were always going for Caleb’s beard, but this time there was no joy or laughter in the gesture.
He glanced down at Leo’s mom. “You’re sure that she’s …”
Griz nodded gravely. “A few minutes ago.”
So that’s why the children looked so horrified. That’s why Rachel was crying, and Angel too, now that he could see more clearly.
But did that mean … Uh-oh.
He’d prayed to reach home before Rachel heard the news from Fairbanks. Maybe he’d been wrong to wish so hard.
He glanced at Angel, who right now seemed the less broken of the two women. “Did you end up getting the radio to work?”
Angel nodded her head. “We got through this morning. They didn’t tell us much, just to conserve the battery and check in every few hours. We would have tried again, but then …” She gestured to the entire room and shrugged. 
So, they didn’t know. And now Caleb was here, and now with a friend of theirs dead on the couch and her tiny baby here in his arms, completely oblivious, he was going to have to tell them all.
He thought for a moment about sending the kids away. He thought for a moment about talking to Rachel alone. But he couldn’t. As of today, the children were adults. And everyone here was in this tragedy together.
“I was at the station with Dev,” he began, but before he could continue, there was a knock at the door. Without waiting for an answer, Dev let himself in. He was a few years younger than Caleb but was panting hard from their sprint. 
“I’m here,” he said but didn’t seem to be phased by the infant in Caleb’s arms or the tears on his wife’s face. 
“I was just going to tell them,” Caleb explained.
Rachel jerked her head up, and he could see the way the little indent of her throat quivered. “Tell us what?” she demanded. 
Her voice didn’t sound like hers at all. Even the dog seemed to notice, and Cammy took a few timid steps forward and sniffed her.
He couldn’t stand here and make them wait. This wasn’t like tearing off a Band-Aid, though. This was like dropping an atomic bomb right in the center of their living room.
“Dev and I got the radio rig working,” he told them. “We picked up an emergency broadcast from FEMA. Both bases in Fairbanks were bombed. Cell phones and devices there detonated, there are fires all over the city, and no emergency vehicles are working.”

***

Tic had never heard anyone, let alone his own mother, cry that way. No, it wasn’t a cry. It was like a wail, but more intense. For a moment, it sounded as if the devil himself had wrapped himself in her lungs and she was trying to exorcise him and an army of demons with nothing but her voice.
Instinctively, he turned to his dad, who seemed to note how worried he was and gave him a grim nod. 
Tic went to his mom, knelt down by her feet, and threw his arms around her waist. It was a strange and intimate posture. Benji was watching, and Tic knew he was way too old for this type of display, but it was all he could think to do. 
Besides, the gesture wasn’t for him.
It was for his mom.
She leaned her head over him as if her body would collapse if he didn’t hold her up. In no time at all, his shoulder was wet from her tears. Loud, shaking breaths racked her whole body, and Tic wondered if she was struggling to breathe. Did they need to do anything to help her? Was this some kind of asthma flare-up? A heart attack?
Again he looked to his father. Dad’s expression was deadly serious, but not afraid.
For several moments, time didn’t exist. The Singhs didn’t exist. Neither did Griz or the baby or — most surprisingly of all — the dead woman lying just a few feet away from all of them on the couch. In that moment, Tic was aware of a permanent shift. He wasn’t a child needing comfort from his mother anymore.
He never would be again.
For sixteen years, she’d fed him and loved him and fussed over him. She’d bandaged his scraped knees and kissed his cuts and watched cartoons with him while he recovered from his tonsillectomy and rushed onto the basketball court in the middle of a game the night his knee decided to pop completely out of its socket.
It would never be like that again. Now, it was his turn to take care of her.
“I know, Mom. I know.” He didn’t really understand what he was saying or why. He just knew it was what she needed to hear. 
“I know,” he repeated. “I’m here. It’s okay.”
Except it wasn’t okay. Nothing was okay. A woman had frozen to death out in the cold, unable to call for help because all the cell phones were dead. Tic’s sister was trapped in Fairbanks, the city was on fire, but the scariest part wasn’t Yaya out there on her own but the way his mother had simply crumpled under the news. 
When he glanced up long enough to look into her face, she looked as old as Grandma. Or even worse.
“Dad?” His voice quivered, but he didn’t know exactly what he was asking. 
The next moment, Dad was there, next to Tic on the floor by Mom’s feet. He held her hand in his. He didn’t say anything, but Tic thought he heard the smallest of whines.
It might have come from the dog. Cammy was as stressed and anxious as the rest of them. But Tic was pretty sure the sound came from his father, whose lips were pressed together so tightly his entire jaw trembled.
“Dad?” he asked again, but Dad just shook his head.
There were no words. Not now.
Soon they would have to speak. Tic would have to ask him what it all meant, what was going to happen, what would become of their family. But for right now, his only job was to sit here and let his mom lean her entire body against him. He was strong, and he would hold her up. Even if the entire house — the entire world — crumbled down around them, he would be here with her.
So help him God.  


13. FIRE AND FLAMES

The world hung suspended in gloomy twilight. Candlelight flickered on the walls, illuminating their living room with an eerie orange glow, reminding Rachel of some macabre mixture of Halloween decorations and what she’d expect to see inside a Gothic cathedral.
According to the wall clock, it wasn’t even 5:00 yet, not even time for Dev’s radio devotions on KJWD to start. But of course, there’d be no broadcast tonight.
Would there ever be again?
It didn’t make sense. None of this made sense. Twenty-four hours ago, Rachel was worrying about her daughter, praying over her midterms, asking God to keep Yaya healthy and sustain her through her second semester of college. Tic was at basketball practice, giving Rachel even more things to worry about, more things to add to her prayer list: that he wouldn’t reinjure his knee, that his season wouldn’t get cut short like it had last year after two of their starting players got expelled.
And now this. A cold, dark house. The world in chaos. A crying baby Angel was trying to feed with a spoon since they had formula in their home but no bottles.
Neither her dog nor her son had left Rachel’s side all afternoon, and she worried that the stress was making Cammy even more neurotic and forcing Tic to assume far more emotional responsibility than a boy his age should have to endure.
On the one hand, millions of individuals have lived through wars or bombings or plagues or devastating natural disasters. On the other hand, nobody in all of human history, at least until today, had ever lived through a technological failure of this magnitude.
They still didn’t know what was behind any of it, or if the scope was national or global. Dev had checked in on Priyah’s ham radio a few times, but he didn’t want to waste battery power, and none of their calls had revealed any significant news. The power was still out around the entire nation. Fairbanks was still burning, with no one to tell them or even estimate the extent of the damage, the number of dead, or the desperate condition of the survivors. Even something as simple as tracking the Fairbanks weather, a habit Rachel had picked up during Yaya’s very first week of school, was now impossible. With no phones, no internet, no public broadcasting services, they were completely isolated and cut off from everybody.
While Angel fed the baby, or at least tried to, Dev and Priyah were tinkering with the radio. Benji was trekking in and out, carrying in stacks of wood to keep their home heated.
And Caleb, her beloved husband of twenty-one years, was completely delusional.
“I’m going to get Yaya,” he stated with manic energy as he paced the entire length of the house. “I’m going to get her, and I am going to bring her back home.”
Tic looked up at Mom with heartbreaking hopefulness in his expression. Tic, her baby boy, who had always idolized Caleb, who loved and fiercely protected his sister, whose life and childhood would never be the same after today. 
Tic, who shouldn’t have to witness his father go completely crazy before his very eyes.
“You’re not going to Fairbanks,” Rachel stated. It had always been their policy not to fight in front of the kids, let alone a house full of guests. But that rule didn’t seem to make particular sense at the moment, especially given the fact that Caleb was completely delusional. 
“The city is burning,” Caleb argued, as if Rachel might have forgotten. “We have no idea what’s going on at the campus. Once they run out of basic resources, it’s going to be a bloodbath. We’re not leaving our daughter stranded in a big city in the middle of the apocalypse.”
Rachel didn’t even know where to begin. First of all, this wasn’t an apocalypse, at least not in the biblical sense. Nowhere in the Book of Revelation did it even come close to mentioning exploding cell phones. 
But more importantly, there was no way for Caleb to get to Fairbanks. They had confirmed with Griz, the Singhs, and neighbors on both sides of their property. All the vehicles were completely useless, heavy lawn ornaments. Nobody could drive anywhere, and nobody could walk from here to Fairbanks and back in the middle of winter. Especially not someone in Caleb’s condition.
Sure, he lifted weights and a couple years ago trained to complete a 5K fun run. But he fell into that category most doctors would euphemistically describe as overweight. And let’s be honest. He might look like an Alaskan mountain man with his flannels and Carhartts and long, unkempt beard, but he was a middle-school teacher, not a forest ranger or a search and rescue professional or some superhero father like you’d see in a movie. Aside from going hunting with a few guys from church to bring home a caribou or two, he wasn’t even really all that outdoorsy.
She wished that Dev would chime in and talk some sense into his best friend, but he was so fixated on his daughter’s radio he probably couldn’t hear a word they were saying.
Caleb stopped pacing long enough to stare at Angel in the kitchen. She was still trying to spoon milk into the baby’s mouth while Leo fussed and wiggled. By the looks of it, the pair were getting more formula on Angel’s shirt than in his belly.
“Don’t we have a baby bottle or two left over from that pregnancy center fundraiser?” Caleb asked.
Rachel was relieved to find her husband talking about something other than an impossible 250-mile trek across the state in the dead of winter. It was almost refreshing to think of something as mundane as misplaced clutter.
“I might have put them in one of the drawers in the closet, or they could be in that pile of stuff in the basement I’ve been meaning to take to the church.”
“Do you want me to go look?” Tic asked.
At the sound of his voice, Priyah looked up from her electronics to cast him a furtive glance, while a flush of red crept up her cheeks. Rachel’s heart wanted to split in two when she tried to imagine the type of earth that children like Tic and Priyah were now destined to come of age in. 
Slowly, she shook her head. “No,” she told Tic. “I wouldn’t even know where to have you start looking.” What she didn’t want to tell him was that letting him out of her sight might destroy her.
“I’ll go check the closet,” Caleb offered. “I’ve got some things to put together upstairs anyway.”
Rachel stared at him blankly. “What things?”
When she saw the resolve in her husband’s eyes, she wondered why God didn’t just suck out the remaining breath from her lungs right now. It would certainly be easier and far more merciful than this horrible, prolonged torture of an existence.
“I need to pack,” Caleb told her, halfway up the stairs. “I already told you. I’m going to Fairbanks, and I’m going to bring our daughter home.”

***

“So, a bunch of us were talking,” Lilly said. “They want to go back to the dorms and find blankets and things before it gets dark.”
Yaya could barely process what her friend was blabbering on about. “Yeah, okay.”
“Do you wanna come with us, or do you wanna stay here and I’ll bring you back some stuff?”
“That sounds good.” Yaya looked up when she realized Lilly didn’t respond. “What?” 
Lilly looked down at Boone, asleep on the floor where they’d found him. His wound was bandaged, and there weren’t any more signs of visible bleeding. He’d woken up several hours earlier and assured her his injuries weren’t as bad as they looked. Still, she wasn’t going to leave his side.
“Are you sure you’re okay?” Lilly asked. “I mean, you haven’t gotten up from this spot since we found him. You haven’t moved, you haven’t eaten …”
“What’s there to eat?” Yaya didn’t mean to snap, but it was as if her friend was telling her to simply click her heels together three times and wish that today had never happened.
“I told you, there are people in the cafeteria giving out bag lunches. I brought you one, and you haven’t touched it.”
Yaya eyed the paper sack on the floor, only vaguely remembering when and how it appeared at her side. “I’m not hungry,” she murmured.
Lilly lowered her voice. “Look, I know this Boone guy’s important to you. And I never wanted to outright ask you, but I know you were meeting him late at night and maybe there was more to it than …”
“There wasn’t anything like that,” Yaya interrupted impatiently. What was Lilly thinking? Had PTSD made her go crazy?
“Okay.” Lilly raised her hand conciliatorily. “I’m just saying, it’s great you’re looking after him, but you need to look after yourself too. Have you even used the bathroom?”
Yaya shook her head. “I haven’t had anything to drink.”
“Well, that’s an even bigger problem. Come on, we’ve been melting snow all day.” She stood up and a moment later returned with a lab flask filled with something that looked similar to water.
“Is it clean?” Yaya asked suspiciously.
Lilly shrugged. “Couple people built a small fire outside to try to boil it, but it’s too cold. We’ve been drinking it all day and no one’s gotten sick yet.”
The water was lukewarm and reeked of ash. Normally, the first sip would have been enough to make Yaya spit it out, but she was thirstier than she realized, and thankful that she had a friend watching out for her.
“Good.” Lilly rewarded her with a tired smile. “Okay, so when you need it, here’s the bathroom situation. Guys are peeing outside. Girls are using the girls’ room for number one. The boys’ room is for anybody to go number two. The people at the cafeteria will be doing bag lunches again in the morning, and they’ll try to give everyone enough to last the day. Someone mentioned the Red Cross, so by this time tomorrow if we’re still here there will be cots and real water and that kind of stuff. Just pretend we were duped into buying tickets to one of those horrible music festivals and ended up having to sleep in FEMA tents.”
Yaya loved her friend for trying so hard to keep a positive attitude. She knew none of this was easy on Lilly either, especially since she must still be worried sick about her boyfriend. “No word yet from Kai?” she asked.
Lilly’s smile vanished. “No.”
“Everything’s crazy around here.” Yaya tried to come up with a comforting lie. “Just wait, you’ll go to the dorms to pick up some blankets and he’ll be there scrolling his phone like nothing happened.”
The girls shared an exhausted, pitiful chuckle, then Lilly turned toward the exit. “Okay, I’ll go grab us some blankets and pillows. And when I come back, I want the food in that brown bag to be in your belly.”
“Yes, Mother.” Yaya had been trying to make a joke, but her throat seized up at the word. She turned her gaze back toward Boone, choking back her tears, finding herself praying to a God she didn’t think she still believed in.

***

Caleb had never seen his wife this angry or this anxious, not even that time when a preteen Tic sneaked onto a friend’s four-wheeler without parental permission (or a helmet), crashed into a tree, and gave himself a concussion.
She should understand. This was the woman who had raced onto the court in the middle of a basketball game when Tic’s knee popped out of place. Caleb hadn’t even noticed it happen. He was sitting there in the bleachers watching Tic’s team lose terribly. Next thing he knew, his wife was on the court, bent over their injured son.
This was the same woman who had driven 250 miles to take their daughter to the clinic when she got strep throat last semester. Yaya could have literally walked to the campus health center in five minutes, but Rachel — unable to stand the idea of her daughter being sick away from home — had packed up five freezer bags of homemade chicken soup, called to set up Yaya’s appointment for her, and made the drive to Fairbanks.
If anyone could understand Caleb’s need to find their daughter, it should be her.
“Population centers are going to be deadly,” he tried to explain. “Riots and looting, and that’s just the beginning.” That’s why he had to go rescue their daughter.
But Rachel was adamant, more stubborn and upset than he’d ever seen her before, without a trace remaining of his teasing, joking wife. “If you mention walking to Fairbanks one more time, I’m burning your bunny boots in the fire.”
When he mentioned traveling barefoot, she didn’t even realize he was joking.
“Don’t forget,” she glowered, “I know the code to the gun safe.”
“So what are you gonna do?” he asked, wanting to laugh at the absurdity of this conversation. “Shoot me in the knee? You don’t even know how to fire that thing.”
“I’ll figure it out,” she answered with deadly seriousness.
 They argued for over an hour until Griz said he needed help outside. At first, Caleb assumed this was a pity ploy designed to give him a break from the yelling, except it was anything but.
They needed to find a way to bury Dani. 
Who would have thought that pounding nails while building a makeshift coffin could be so cathartic? 
While Caleb hammered away, his breath freezing his entire beard, Griz set to work building a large fire at the farthest corner of the Winters’ back yard. 
“We’ll need to keep it going all night to give the ground a chance to thaw,” Griz explained. “The five of us men will take turns tending it.”
Caleb was going to remind him there were only three men here. Then he realized Griz had included both Tic and Benji in his counting. 
Without ever having had the actual discussion or extending an official invitation, it was understood that the Singhs would stay here. People could start in the rooms upstairs, but if those got too cold they could move their mattresses and blankets into the living room.
What still hadn’t been decided, or at least not agreed upon, was whether Caleb was going to Fairbanks to get Yaya. Dev had picked up a few more FEMA reports on the radio. All the major military bases in Alaska were destroyed, although it was still unclear who had fired on them. Russia was a likely culprit, but there were still no official reports. Canada and the Lower 48 were off-grid, and cell phones had exploded in all their big cities just like in Alaska.
An even more alarming layer to the terror was reports of planes everywhere – dozens of them – crashing into population centers. As hard as it was being cut off in the middle of nowhere, Caleb had to assume it was safer than being almost anywhere else.
Which was exactly why he needed to get Yaya. His argument with Rachel had strung along late enough that nothing could happen until morning, but when the sun rose, he was going to be on his way. 
If he had suspected that Rachel could even figure out how to use his gun, let alone have the fortitude to fire it, he might have paused given the intensity in her expression when she made her threat. But he knew his wife. She didn’t even watch gunfights in movies but shut her eyes and begged Caleb to turn down the volume.
Unfortunately, that led Caleb to an entirely new set of worries. If he headed to Fairbanks, that left Rachel and Tic alone. The Singhs would be here, but Dev was definitely more of the turn-the-other-cheek kind of Christian than the don’t-tread-on-me-or-I’ll-shoot-you-in-the-face type that were so common out here in rural Alaska. Angel was as small and unassuming as Rachel, and now they also had Dani’s baby to care for, leaving everyone even more vulnerable.
He took a pause from his work and walked toward Griz, who sat on an overturned bucket staring at the blazing fire he’d built.
“Hey Griz, let me ask you a question.”
Griz turned to him silently.
“I want you to do me a favor. A big one.”
Griz simply lifted his chin in an approximation of a nod.
“I’m leaving for Fairbanks tomorrow to bring Yaya home. While I’m gone, I want you to stay here and help take care of my wife and house.”
Griz was silent. His working eye turned back to gaze at the fire that was thawing the earth so they could bury their neighbor. 
If ever there was a time for friends to help each other out, wasn’t this it?
“We’ve got food and heat,” Caleb told him, thinking of every positive argument that might convince him to stay. “And I have a hand pump so we can get well water.” He continued to speak, if for no other reason than to fill the silence.
When Griz finally responded, his voice was as low as the crackling of the wood on the flame. “My uncle used to say something.” 
He paused for so long Caleb wondered if more was coming. 
Finally, Griz stated, “It takes only one to shoot the moose, but two to carry it home.”
Usually, Caleb was riveted on those rare times when Griz spoke about his Alaska native heritage or mentioned anything about his past. But today he didn’t have the patience for riddles. 
“So … you’ll stay here while I’m gone?” he pressed.
Griz shook his head gravely. “You won’t make it. It’s a fool’s mission.”
Caleb was taken aback, as shocked as if the sparks flying around them had set his beard ablaze. “I’m going to get my daughter. No matter what it takes, I have to bring her home.” 
Why did he have to keep on repeating himself like this to everyone around him? Maybe Rachel could never understand, but he was certain that Griz …
His old friend held up his hand to interrupt Caleb’s mounting monologue. 
“I won’t stay here.” He continued to stare straight into the fire, the flames casting shadows that danced across his scarred face. “But I will help you.”
Caleb was so frustrated by Griz’s inability to answer a single question that he wanted to scream.
Then Griz turned to him with a warm expression. “I’m going with you.”
Caleb could only stare back at him, wondering if he’d heard correctly.
“I know the road,” Griz continued. “I can hunt. I’ve got cold-weather equipment. You can’t make it alone. But together, we can bring your daughter home.”

***

“No. Absolutely not. Positively not. No way on God’s green earth. The answer is no.” Rachel was pacing the room while her husband sat dejected on their bed.
What was Caleb thinking? He’d truly and actually lost his mind. It was the trauma of the day. Call it PTSD or something. Caleb was genuinely, completely, and in all other ways insane.
“I told you, if Griz and I go together …”
“Griz?” She wanted to spit his name. “You know I respect him. We owe Tic’s life to that man, for crying out loud. But there are dozens of reasons a man like that becomes a hermit who shows himself in public once a season or less, and none of them are good.”
“You know he’s retired from the Marines.”
“I know he said he’s retired from the Marines,” Rachel corrected. “But seriously. The man is a complete recluse, and not in the normal rural-Alaska kind of way. It’s not right. There’s something wrong …”
“He saved Tic’s life,” Caleb interrupted, as if Rachel ever needed to be reminded. There was no way she could look at that scar on Griz’s face, the spot where his eye should be, and not remember what happened.
“Yes, he saved Tic’s life,” she conceded. “I thank God every single day for that. But that doesn’t mean we know him. What’s next? He saved Tic all those years ago, so now we name him the executor of our estate? We make him an authorized user on our credit cards? We let him adopt our son?”
Caleb stared at her as if she had truly lost the plot. Perhaps she had.
Rachel took a deep breath and tried again. “Listen, there is no one in the world more worried for Yaya right now than me.” 
Seeing Caleb raise his hand in protest, she preemptively interrupted his arguments. “Call me narrow-minded if you want. But there is nobody, literally nobody in the entire world, who will worry more than a mother. I get that you love Yaya. I get that you want to do anything in your power to protect her. I understand that. But what you don’t understand is that this child was in my womb. Our bloodstreams were connected. Any emotion I experienced, any bite of food I ate, any molecule of oxygen I breathed, it was all shared with her. My life, my cells, my being literally went into that little baby. And the day she left home …” Here Rachel’s voice caught, and she had to recenter herself.
“The day she left home, I felt like this invisible umbilical cord that had kept us connected for the first eighteen years of her life was yanked out of my uterus so brutally and so violently it’s a wonder I didn’t hemorrhage to death right then.”
Caleb tried to open his mouth, but she wasn’t finished.
“I know you love Yaya. We both do. But I have absolutely no way to say this any clearer than I am right now. You will not survive a trip to Fairbanks in these conditions. If you try it, you’ll die from the cold. And then Tic and I will be left here alone, and Yaya will still …”
This time, she didn’t try to stop the sob that welled its way up from the core of her being.
Caleb was there, wrapping his arms around her, and she wondered at the absurdity of marriage. Here he was, this monster who was about to kill her by making plans to leave, a man she only half-jokingly threatened to shoot if he tried to walk away. And yet his arms were the only possible comfort in the entire universe.
“I don’t know what else to do,” Caleb whispered into her hair. He pulled back and stared into her eyes. “Our daughter needs me. She needs us, her family. What are we supposed to do? Just sit around worrying about her until the stress literally kills us both?”
Yes, that had basically been Rachel’s plan. Either that or wait for the power to be miraculously restored, for life to go back to how it was meant to be.
“Listen.” Caleb rubbed her arms, as if he wanted to physically transfer his love and comfort and strength into her body through the movement. “I will never forget the day you gave birth to our beautiful baby girl. You were covered in sweat and your voice was raw from screaming, and I will always remember the look on your face when I told you what you’d shouted at that nurse.”
Rachel couldn’t help but return her husband’s smile, even though her throat ached from suppressed sobs and her entire soul exhausted from fear.
“And when she came, she was so perfect, and she was so beautiful, and I was so proud of you, and I was so scared I was going to do something wrong. Remember how freaked out I was to even hold her? I was convinced I’d drop her.”
Rachel could only nod.
“But then the nurse showed me what to do and put this little unblemished thing in my arms. And this perfect little child that we created together hadn’t breathed in a single speck of pollution or encountered a single germ in her entire life, and my heart was so full even though I was still so scared, and I told God I would do anything to protect her.” He lowered his voice and leveled his gaze. “Anything.”
Rachel rested her head against Caleb’s chest, resisting her body’s urge to let go, to give in. He couldn’t do this. He couldn’t leave. 
On the one hand, she understood what he was saying completely. On the other hand, Caleb’s plan was as ridiculous as if their daughter had gotten herself stranded on Mars and he’d announced he was going to charter a private jet to bring her back.
“You can’t go,” she whispered faintly.
“Well, nothing is happening tonight.”
Rachel’s body relaxed just a bit, and relief flooded her with warmth in spite of how cold their bedroom had grown.
“The guys and I are going to take shifts watching the fire,” Caleb said. “Tic and Benji are out there now, then they’ll come switch with me. I doubt I’m going to get any sleep, but I may as well try. Tomorrow, we’ll figure out what’s happening. Maybe we’ll get more news on the radio.”
Rachel clung to his words the same way Cammy would hang onto her favorite chew toy during a raucous game of tug. Caleb realized it was pointless to leave this evening, which meant that tomorrow he’d have time to come to his senses and give up this ridiculous plan altogether.
Except something was shifting inside Rachel’s chest. She didn’t know how or why, but she knew the gentle tug of intuition when she felt it. Was God telling her to be ready to surrender Caleb to the unknown road ahead?
While her husband changed into his pajamas, she wondered if she was going to have to go through their entire argument all over again, only this time with God Almighty himself. And in that case, it was even less likely for Rachel to end up getting her way.
Downstairs, the house was silent. On their bed, Cammy was curled up by Rachel’s pillow.
Rachel slid under the covers, tucking herself and Cammy under the extra-thick blankets they’d pulled up from storage. 
God, she prayed, you know I want to follow and obey you. But please, Lord, either stop Caleb from trying to get to Fairbanks, or else part the waters and send some kind of miracle so he’s not trying to make the trip on foot.
Rachel didn’t know exactly what she was praying for. A hitched-up dogsled team just appearing in their driveway in the morning? Dev working his tinkering magic to make two snow machines run and have enough gas to get Caleb and Griz to Fairbanks and back? A magic carpet sounded just as plausible.
But at least they had time to figure it out. Best-case scenario: Caleb would wake up tomorrow, lean over and give her a kiss, and tell her he realized a trip to Fairbanks was impossible. 
No, scratch that. Best-case scenario was waking up in the morning, hearing on the radio that the power grid had been restored back to normal, and all vehicles and cell phones were now completely operable.
The image fueled her prayers as she did her best to drift off to sleep.

***

“You okay, bro?” Benji asked as the two boys stared at the dancing flames. 
Usually, Tic loved a good campfire. He couldn’t count the number of times he and Benji had been out here in the back yard, strumming their guitars or goofing off around the fire pit just like this.
Except not just like this, because this wasn’t a campfire. This was a funeral fire, designed solely to warm the ground enough that they could try to bury some pieced-together coffin his dad built for a woman young enough she could have been Tic’s older sister. 
He hadn’t known Dani well, but he had known her. Other than random relatives in the Lower 48 he barely remembered, nobody else in Tic’s life had ever died, certainly not like this, and certainly not in his own house. 
He poked at the firewood and shrugged. That was one thing he liked about Benji. They didn’t have to talk if they didn’t feel like it. Except tonight, Benji didn’t seem to be in the mood to shut up.
“So what do you think it was?” he asked.
“What do you mean?” was all Tic could think to say, even though he knew quite well what Benji meant.
“The attacks and stuff. You know, the bombs and cell phones.”
Tic shrugged. “Some kind of cyberattack.”
“Yeah, I know, but who was behind it? Think it was Russia? I heard they wanted to try to annex Alaska.”
“This stuff all happened in the Lower 48, too,” Tic replied. 
As much as he didn’t want to have this conversation, or any conversation, right now, he’d been wondering the same thing.
“It couldn’t just be like a solar flare though, right?” Benji went on. “Not with all the bases getting bombed or planes being flown into buildings. So there must be someone behind it.”
“I dunno, man.” Tic poked at the fire again, feeling a tiny hit of satisfaction when a log moved and crackled and sent sparks flying into the winter air.
“You think your sister’s all right?” Benji asked after a pause.
Tic shrugged again. “Yaya? Yeah. She’s smart. She’s scrappy. And she’s pretty good at keeping her cool.” He thought of the way his sister acted on the opening night of a play. She didn’t get nervous, she said, just excited, like the adrenaline in her system made her extra attentive. Wherever she was, whatever she was doing, Tic imagined her using that same degree of calm and focus to seek shelter, find warmth, and stay safe.
At least he prayed she could, as best as he was able. Prayer had always been his mother’s spiritual gift, not his. He wasn’t long-winded or eloquent, and he couldn’t remember the last time he even prayed for a full minute without getting distracted.
But still he tried his hardest, and he hoped to heaven that God would hear him now.  


14. THE DECISION

Caleb was surprised he managed any sleep at all after keeping a four-hour vigil around the fire in the backyard. Even more surprising was that the sun was already rising when he woke up.
Rachel was out of bed, and he hoped she wasn’t still mad at him over yesterday’s argument. He understood she was worried about him going to Fairbanks, but his mind was made up. Last night beside the flames, he’d prayed long and hard and asked God to show him if there was another way, if going to rescue his daughter was the suicide mission Rachel seemed to think it was.
And while he never got an assurance of success, he knew he had to try. Protecting his family was in his DNA, just like worrying about them was in Rachel’s. That was how God designed them both, and it was pointless for either of them to fight against their nature.
He’d spent some time last night talking to Griz and figuring out a plan. First things first: as soon as the ground was even remotely thawed, they’d bury Dani. Whatever they couldn’t get completely underground they’d cover with logs and twigs and gravel and dirt. The unsightly mound would remain until spring, when the grass would grow over it and the landmark would remain as a permanent scar, a permanent reminder in their yard of what they’d gone through.
Next, Caleb had a mental checklist of things to gather. Griz had high-quality cold-weather gear from his years spent as an arctic warfare specialist, so he’d be in charge of tents and sleeping bags and survival equipment. Caleb had to find the lightest clothes he could, lots of extra socks, flashlights, food, and of course both his .44 Magnum revolver and AR-10. Between both of these, he’d be prepared for any threat — the four-footed or the two-footed kind. He was leaving the AR-15 here since it was a small enough caliber that Rachel could theoretically manage the gun if necessary. Not that she’d ever been willing to touch the thing in the past, even when he begged her to learn. But God alone knew what the future held in store for her and Tic. 
God alone knew how someone like his peace-loving wife might have to harden and change in the days and weeks to come. 
Before he got out of bed, he reached for his pen and old abandoned journal in his nightstand drawer. He’d composed a good-bye letter to Rachel in his mind last night by the fire, and today he had to jot it all down. Actually, he’d composed two. One to give her before he left. 
And one to hide somewhere in the house in case the journey didn’t go as planned.
The first one was easy to write. He told her how much he loved her, how much the past 21 years had meant to him, how she’d grown ever more beautiful with each passing day. He added some of her favorite Bible verses from the Sermon on the Mount, hoping their lessons about faith and worry would carry her through whatever came next.
The second letter was infinitely harder. What do you put in a letter for your wife to read in case you never come home? I’m sorry I couldn’t save our daughter. Caleb wasn’t even sure she could survive such a devastating blow. 
In the end, he turned to the last page of his journal, then simply wrote the day’s date and Dear Rachel, I love you so much and always will. 
He dressed in layers like Griz instructed him. A thin underlayer, nothing that would get too wet with sweat. Something heavy on top but not too bulky since they’d be carrying rucksacks and tents and all their gear on their backs the entire trip.
He was about to head downstairs when Rachel cautiously opened their door. “I heard you up,” she said, her voice weak and low.
He took her into his arms, and she sank against his chest. “You’re going?” It wasn’t a question so much as a declaration. The fact that she was resigned to his leaving didn’t bring him any relief, only sorrow.
He laid his chin against the top of her head, urging his body to remember everything about this moment. The feel of her cotton hoodie. The way her legs pressed up against his. 
“Sometimes I forget just how short you are,” he said, and they both laughed sadly.
“Dev and Griz are out back,” she told him. “They’re going to dig up what they can, then start another fire before …” She didn’t finish the thought. She didn’t have to.
“Is Tic awake?” Caleb asked. 
“No, I thought I’d let him and Benji try to sleep in as long as they could.”
“Good idea.”
These were the words that were spoken between them this morning. These were the words that would ring in Caleb’s ears on the miles and miles of road ahead of him.
But these weren’t the words they meant to say.
Thankfully, Caleb knew his wife well enough that he could translate the silence, and he was convinced she could too. When Caleb asked about Tic, he was telling his wife that she had to let her son grow up now. Tic would be the man of the house, and instead of always rushing to be the one to protect him, she had to learn to let him take care of her.
When Rachel talked about the funeral they would hold for Dani, she wasn’t just mourning a friend she’d lost. She was telling Caleb how terrified she was that he would walk away today and never come home, and they wouldn’t even have a mound of dirt in the backyard to remember him by.
“I love you,” he said, and in those three words were years of memories: The first time they met when she was that cute little assistant working at the Christian bookstore in Anchorage and he was a young, impassioned Bible college student trying to track down a hard-to-find title. The next Sunday he happened to show up at the same church she happened to mention she attended, and they happened to recognize each other and smile.
That smile had warmed Caleb’s soul more than the twenty-four-hour sunlight on the summer solstice ever could.
“I love you, too,” she whispered, her words adding onto the memories: Their Bible debates in the singles Sunday school class they both happened to join. Caleb’s painfully awkward declaration before they’d even gone on their first date. Rachel’s shy but enthusiastic response. Their wedding six months later, right here in her parents’ home in Glennallen. The joys and trials and hardships of their growing family. And every single moment of their lives they’d spent together since then. 
Thinking of the morning ahead — the burial, the packing, the preparations that still had to take place — Caleb wondered if this was the last private moment he’d ever share with his wife. He knew God was calling him to this mission, but he wasn’t naïve enough to believe that meant he was promised a safe return or Rachel a happy ending.
There was more he wanted to say. More he wanted to remember.
But the sun was rising in the pale pink winter sky, and the miles stretched out before him.
It was going to be a long day.

***

Caring for baby Leo was a welcome distraction for Rachel while Angel fussed in her kitchen, pulling together ingredients for breakfast. If Rachel had been cooking, she’d settle again on oatmeal, but if it made Angel feel useful she could at least try for something more creative. 
And seeing as how Angel was the perfect wife, homeschool mom, and homemaker, maybe Rachel shouldn’t underestimate her.
Leo had been happy all morning, ever since Dev had taken the snow machine to Dani’s house and come home with plenty of bottles and diapers. Rachel sat amazed at the way someone so small and tiny could hold up that big head of his and look around the room with those bright, wide eyes that didn’t miss anything.
She watched him with a melancholy sense of awe and nostalgia. Had Yaya and Tic truly ever been this small?
Where had the time gone?
“I can’t even picture my kids at this age,” Rachel confessed. 
“I know what you mean,” Angel agreed, then asked somewhat distractedly, “You have potatoes somewhere?”
“In the pantry.” Rachel was surprised when her friend started pulling out potatoes, onions, garlic … even a couple turnips.
“What are you making with that?” she asked.
“I think I’ll do a breakfast hash. Can you show me where you keep your cutting boards?”
Twenty minutes later, the smell of garlic and onion mingled with the scent of sizzling bacon and smoked salmon. The boys were still upstairs and the men were outside trying to get the ground as thawed as possible, so it made the most sense for everyone to eat in shifts.
“Think the scrambled egg is too chewy for a six-month-old?” Rachel asked when she saw the way Leo was trying to grab at her fork.
“If it were me, I’d mash up some of the potato and turnips,” Angel said.
“Was he already eating cereals or solids yet?” Rachel tried to remember her conversations with Dani while they worked together at the food bank. They’d talked about the foster agency and the social workers and the piles of adoption paperwork. They’d talked about the inconvenience of buying diapers and formula in bulk so you didn’t have to drive into town every week and waste hours of your life.
But she couldn’t remember them ever talking about food.
“Miss Dani showed me how to make him a little rice cereal last time I babysat.” Priyah had been so quiet all morning, Rachel had started to wonder if she was so scarred by yesterday she might never speak again.
“She did? Did he take to it okay? I mean did he like it?”
“Yeah.” A little grin spread across Priyah’s face. “He got real excited and started to babble really fast like he wanted more.”
Somehow this little tidbit about baby Leo’s diet made Rachel smile more than anything else had all morning long. She felt like she had missed something vitally important when her own children were this age.
Maybe Leo was God’s second-chance gift. She just hoped this time she wouldn’t mess it all up like she had in the past …
“Why don’t you grab me a little bowl and mash up a few pieces of potato,” Rachel suggested. “Maybe add a tiny bit of that distilled water to it. Do you remember about how runny the rice cereal was you gave him before? Try to make it about like that again.”
When the mashed potatoes were ready, Rachel tested to make sure they weren’t too hot and was about to give Leo his first bite when she got a better idea. She handed the spoon to Priyah. “Here,” she said. “Do you want to see if he likes it?”
Priyah looked to her mother, who gave her a warm smile. Priyah bit her lip as if trying to suppress a grin, but when Leo burst into enthusiastic wiggles at the sight of the food, none of them could stifle their laughter.
It took a couple tries before Priyah managed to get the spoon to Leo’s mouth before he could grab it and turn them both into a messy glob of potato goop, but when he tasted that first bite, he let out an exuberant squeal. The kitchen erupted in even more laughter, and suddenly there was nothing any of them wanted to do more than see if they could get Leo to make that same sound again.
The world might be ending. Cities might be burning. Humanity might be forever scarred by whatever was going on out there.
But right now, at this exact moment in time, two middle-aged moms and a twelve-year-old girl could still fuss and fawn over a little baby who was excited to eat his first bite of mashed potato and wanted the entire world to know it.

***

Tic hadn’t ever attended a funeral before, at least not any he could remember. And he definitely hadn’t attended one outside in the middle of winter.
Mrs. Singh had stayed inside so Dani’s baby wouldn’t have to go out in the cold. Tic wondered if Leo would miss his foster mom or if he was little enough he wouldn’t even notice her. He hoped that was the case.
Even though they’d already read the Bible and sung a few hymns and prayed in the living room, it felt like all the adults wanted to do the exact same thing now that they were out in the snow. On the one hand, Tic wanted it to be over. It was cold out here, and he hadn’t even known Dani all that well. It felt strange that they were the only ones here, not her real family. Last night Dev called in on Priyah’s radio to tell some operator that Dani had passed away. He wasn’t sure what the man was supposed to do with that information, but gathered this was some sort of prehistoric bulletin board system people used to share news about their loved ones.
They’d given Yaya’s name on the same channel last night, and every couple hours Mom would rush to the radio to see if there were any updates.
There never were.
Beside him, Benji was fidgeting, perhaps as impatient or uncomfortable as he was. Except there was part of Tic that wished for this funeral to stretch on forever. Because once Dani was completely buried, once they were done saying their prayers and covering her coffin over with all that dirt and the extra logs and twigs and leaves he and Benji had gathered up, Dad was leaving.
He’d heard his parents fighting about it last night. Everyone had heard his parents fighting about it last night. And then this morning when he’d woken up to the smell of bacon and potatoes and had gone downstairs to eat Mrs. Singh’s breakfast, Mom told him that Dad and Griz were leaving for Fairbanks as soon as Dani’s service ended. He was surprised the news didn’t shock him more. 
His dad was leaving on a dangerous journey in the middle of winter, and even though nobody would say it out loud, Tic was smart enough and old enough to recognize there wasn’t any guarantee Dad would find Yaya alive once he even got to Fairbanks.
If he even got to Fairbanks. 
Aside from a few summer camps or trips for basketball, Tic had never been away from his dad. Like ever. 
Shouldn’t he feel something? Worried? Sad? Anything?
Dad had given him the “you’re the man of the house now and I’m counting on you to look after your mom” speech after breakfast. But it was like Tic was hearing it underwater. Or listening to a podcast at half speed. The words were all clear and coherent, but they didn’t make any emotional connection in his brain.
He wondered if there was something wrong with him. He couldn’t ask Benji. They spent tons of time together, but it was always shooting hoops or playing guitar or building fires. He wasn’t the kind of friend you sat down and had hour-long conversations with about your feelings. Dad was the one Tic turned to at times like that, except now Dad was also the one who was leaving.
Last week, if he’d been confronted with this hypothetical scenario, Tic could have guessed at half a dozen conflicting emotions he might experience. Anger at his dad for ditching them when the world was collapsing. Jealousy that Dad was going to rescue Yaya with Griz instead of with him. Pride that Dad was entrusting him to look after Mom and the house. Terror that his sister might be dead, his dad might be about to die, and the world was completely and utterly screwed. 
What he didn’t expect was to feel so much … nothing. He was completely hollow. Empty. Unguarded. Like that possessed man Jesus talked about, where after the demons were cast out, even more came and took the first one’s place so that he was worse off than before.
Tic had never experienced anything remotely like this before, and he didn’t claim to have anywhere near the type of intuition Mom seemed to magically display at times. But he knew that this void of emotion couldn’t last for long, and this vacuum where he would have expected sadness or fear or grief to reside would soon give way to something else. 
Something dangerous and untamed. 
Like anger.
He clenched his fists and set his jaw while the mourners around him sang what felt like the twentieth verse of Amazing Grace. Let them sing. Let them grieve. Let Dad leave in search of his little darling daughter and leave Tic here alone while cell phones exploded and bombs ripped cities apart and planes crashed into buildings.
He didn’t care. Like he said, the world was screwed. 
And since he couldn’t fix it, he might as well learn to deal with it.
After the funeral finally ended, they all went inside. Tic expected Dad and Griz to leave right away. They’d already wasted almost half of their daylight. 
But instead of a hurried goodbye, Mom was upstairs (presumably crying) and Dad was showing Dev things around the property since now apparently the Singhs were moving in. So much for Dad trusting Tic to be the man of the house.
Griz was nowhere to be seen, but that was normal for him. He’d come and go and come back again like a ghost. Tic guessed that was probably why he’d done so well as a Force Recon officer in the Marines. 
He respected Griz. After all, the man had saved his life when he was just a baby. Griz’s heroics had lost him an eye and earned him a gruesome facial scar in the process. But still, there was something about him …
“You down here, idiot?” Dad asked, stepping into the basement where Tic had been half-heartedly lifting weights.
“Yeah.” 
Dad gave him a solemn once-over. “You doing okay?”
Tic couldn’t quite meet his gaze. “Yeah.”
“Griz and I are leaving soon.”
“I know.”
His dad sighed. Tic had the impression that he was supposed to say or do or feel more than he was. He just couldn’t.
“So, a few things I want to go over with you before I leave.” Dad started ticking things off on his fingers. “You know where the AR-15 is and all the extra ammunition?”
“Yeah.”
“And you remember the code to get to the handgun up in my safe, right?”
“I remember.”
“Now listen to me.” Dad leveled his gaze. “Those instruments are tools for you to use to defend your home and the ones you love. You never point them at something you’re not willing to destroy. Because the time might come when you have to step up in order to protect your mother. You know how she is with firearms. Even if she wanted to, she probably wouldn’t know where to find the trigger. So if worse comes to worst, the job of defending our home is going to come down to you.”
Even though a moment earlier Tic had been wishing he could feel something other than complete emptiness, he now took it all back and wished to God he could go back to that state of blissful numbness.
But Dad didn’t seem to notice or care about the impact his words were having on him. “As believers, Jesus calls us to feel compassion and grace for everyone,” he continued. “But this whole blackout is going to bring out the worst in people. It might get really, really ugly. And before I go, I need you to tell me that you’re ready to protect Mom and yourself if it comes down to it. Can you do that for me, son?”
Tic hated everything. Hated the tears he couldn’t stop from flowing down his cheeks, hated his voice for refusing to answer, hated his dad for leaving and the world for going to hell before his very eyes.
But he didn’t hate his mother. And he didn’t hate his sister. And the love and fear and protectiveness he felt for his family was the same love and fear and protectiveness he saw now mirrored back in his father’s gaze.
Dad opened his arms, and Tic awkwardly let himself lean into his hug.
“I believe in you, son. No matter what happens, no matter how much time passes, I want you to know that I couldn’t be more proud of you, and I love you with all my soul.”
Tic’s entire body was heaving with sobs, and he didn’t have the strength to answer.

***

There was so much Rachel should be doing. Comforting her friends after they had just buried their neighbor. Helping Angel and Priyah care for baby Leo, who was now everybody’s responsibility to watch over and nurture. Prepare herself for the most difficult good-bye she’d ever said in her life.
Instead, she was here in her room, burying her face in the box she kept tucked away in her closet, the one with all the love letters and pictures and trinkets she and Caleb had amassed over twenty-one years together.
Here were the pictures from that photobooth at the Alaska State Fair. Rachel had been pregnant with Yaya and exhausted from the heat and too nauseated to eat any of the fair food, but still they managed to make it one of the best days of their lives.
Further down were the love letters she’d written Caleb when he went on that two-month-long mission trip to Siberia the summer before they got married. Because he wouldn’t be able to receive any mail, she’d penned one letter for every day that he’d be gone. They were so sappy she was too embarrassed now to even read them, but they were a testimony to their love.
Next, her fingers landed on their wedding album. They both had been so young. Rachel had only been a couple years older than Yaya was now. So young and naïve, still starry-eyed and optimistic about the future, ready to face whatever God or fate threw their way as long as they stood side by side together.
She opened to the first page, and even the images of their rehearsal dinner were too much for her to bear. She was about to bury the album at the bottom of the box when something she hadn’t seen in years slipped out from between the pages.
Rachel couldn’t remember the last time she’d seen, let alone held, a CD. But here was that shiny silver disc in its bright white envelope. Wedding Mix Tape. Rachel and Caleb.
The memories came rushing back to her like an avalanche. The hours she’d spent pulling it together since they couldn’t afford a DJ at their reception. Swaying to the love song theme from Princess Bride for their first dance, even though her dress’s bustle was uneven and she felt like a lopsided fish on land. Laughing and shouting with their friends and family and Jon Bon Jovi himself to Living on a Prayer. Ballads and anthems and love songs, each selected for such a specific reason, each connected to their own torrent of memories. 
The way she’d asked her pastor if it was appropriate to play Heaven by Bryan Adams at a church wedding, since it implied that romantic love was equivalent to paradise. The way it was the first song running through her head when she woke up in her beloved Caleb’s arms the first morning of their honeymoon.
And now she was sobbing, not only from the torrent of memories, but the realization that if the power grid wasn’t fixed, all these songs might be lost forever.
Forever. 
In the early days of their relationship, Caleb had shared his love of music with her. When she was growing up, Rachel’s family listened to classical music and hymns, and when they weren’t home Rachel would sneak a song or two from the pop music station to try to fit in with the cool kids. But it was Caleb who introduced her to all the classic bands he loved, and as she fell in love with him, she fell in love with his soundtracks, too. And now, she was sitting here facing a future where ballerinas would never dance in Elton John’s hand and smalltown girls would never take another midnight train.
Ever again. 
It seemed ridiculous, so shortly after burying Dani and so shortly before saying goodbye to her husband that she would be weeping over a few songs she might not be able to hear again if phones stayed dead and electronics never started back up. But the bleakness and emptiness of the musicless future that now stretched before her and her children was all-consuming, a weight crushing her chest so oppressively she couldn’t breathe, couldn’t gasp, couldn’t even pray.
“Mom?” The timid knock on her door made her glad her sobs had been mostly silent. She wiped her face as dry as she could and got up off the floor.
“Yeah?”
Tic stepped in and placed a bare foot on the bed. “Can you look at my toenail? It’s got this weird thing on the side. I tried using the clippers, but …”
“It’s a hangnail,” she diagnosed. “Here, let me take a better look.”
She grabbed a flashlight from the nightstand. “Looks like it might be getting an infection,” she told him, relieved to have something as mundane as a hurt toe to pull her back to reality. “Let’s go melt some snow and put in some Epsom salt and give it a little soak. I’m guessing it’ll be fine, but I’ll add some Neosporin too, just in case.”
And just like that, she went from being a helpless, sobbing mess on the floor to Tic’s mother, a woman who knew how to take care of her children.
A woman who would put her family first and endure whatever future God had in store for her, just like women and mothers had for centuries and centuries past throughout all of human history.
Downstairs now, her son’s toenail soaked, clipped, and disinfected, Rachel sat at the table, listening to Griz and her husband hash out the last of their plans. Dev had put his engineer’s mind to good use and even made them a chart to keep track of their supplies and ration their food. They certainly weren’t carrying enough to get them to and from Fairbanks, but there were towns along the way as well as game Griz could hunt.
Rachel still couldn’t believe this was really happening. She thought back to last night, when she’d prayed so hard for God to change Caleb’s mind or magically fix the power grid or at least send them a dog sled team out of nowhere. He’d answered prayers like that for George Müller and countless missionaries. 
Why hadn’t he answered hers?
Cammy was restless, alternating between comforting Rachel and whining at Tic’s feet and going over to sniff baby Leo curiously. For the most part, Rachel either ignored her or patted her head mindlessly, but when Cammy growled at the window overlooking the driveway, Rachel grew nervous. All her husband’s warnings about guns and violence and catastrophes like this inviting the worst in mankind was making her paranoid. 
So paranoid she was certain she heard a car pulling up the driveway, which was impossible because all the cars had shut down with the electricity and the internet and the phones and everything else.
She was convinced that she was making things up until Tic glanced out the window and looked back at her, confused. “Mom?”
She jumped to her feet at the unmistakable sound of a car door shutting. What in the world?
Recognizing the station wagon, she rushed to the front door to greet Miss Cecelia, who was bundled up for winter and looked no worse for the catastrophe that had overtaken their world.
“Hello, Rachel.” Miss Cecelia’s voice was curt as usual. “I hate to bother you, but I was wondering if I might borrow Tychicus and Caleb. With the power out, I’m worried about the moose meat I’ve got in the freezer at the pantry. I want to move the whole thing outside and obviously can’t do that myself.”
Rachel blinked. And stared. Then realized she had the front door open and was letting all their heat out. “Um, yeah, of course. We’re right in the middle … why don’t you come in.”
“I don’t need to stay long,” Miss Cecelia declared. “I would have called, but my phone’s out. And did you know, I can’t get KWJD to come in either.”
Rachel’s mind was having trouble processing this conversation. 
“Um, we’ll worry about the meat in a second. But first, how are you? Are you all right?”
Miss Cecelia cocked her head to the side. “Oh, you mean my cough? It’s no worse, at least.”
Rachel couldn’t find a response.
“Or were you talking about the power?” Miss Cecelia went on. “I’ve got a fireplace, and my home is small, so I don’t have anything to worry about except for that meat I mentioned at the pantry. Oh, looks like everyone’s here.” She glanced into the living room. “Dev, did you know the radio station’s down?”
Before she could let Dev answer, Rachel finally managed to blurt out the question that was causing her brain to glitch so hard. “How did you get here?”
Miss Cecelia looked at her as if she’d asked where babies come from. “I drove myself, dear,” she answered dryly.
“I mean, how did you … why didn’t your …” Rachel’s voice was no use.
“She’s asking how your car is working,” Caleb cut in for her.
“Well, it’s not electric, obviously.” Miss Cecelia let out a mirthless chuckle then glanced around the room as if suddenly suspicious of everyone and everything in it.
Caleb looked at Rachel, now apparently just as lost as she was.
It was Dev who stepped up to intervene. “Miss Cecelia,” he said, “have you heard any of the news reports since the power went out?”
“Well, no,” she declared. “I told you, I haven’t been able to tune into KWJD. My phone line’s dead. I’ve been at home reading by the fireplace until now, when I started to worry about the moose meat. Caleb, I was wondering if you and Tychicus might be so kind as to …” 
“This isn’t just a power outage,” Dev interrupted. 
“Well, no, it’s quite longer than normal.”
Dev’s voice never wavered. “Miss Cecelia, I think you need to sit down. We’ll talk about the moose meat in a minute,” he added when she looked determined to butt in again. 
With the patience of an apostle, Dev explained how everything — phones, electricity, internet, even vehicles — were offline, presumably the result of some type of massive attack.
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Miss Cecelia replied, seemingly unperturbed. “As you can see, my station wagon’s operating just fine.”
“How old is it?” Dev asked.
“What?” Miss Cecelia was almost shouting. “I haven’t been able to charge my hearing aids, so you’ll have to speak up.”
“What year is your car, Miss Cecelia?”
She paused for a moment. “Well, when I bought it, that was either under Bush or Clinton, I think. But to be fair with you I’ve got better things to do than bother myself with dates that far back. She’s old, I’ll tell you that, but served me just perfectly, by the way. Never had a day of trouble with her.”
Dev was smiling. “Miss Cecelia, you know what this means?”
“It means I have an old car because I’m an old woman who’s stuck in my ways and doesn’t like change.”
Dev ignored her remark. “It means that you may have one of the only working vehicles left in Glennallen.”
Now Rachel understood how George Müller must have felt when that dairyman appeared at his doorstep with an entire delivery of milk for his orphanage just moments after he prayed. She clasped her hands together and beamed at her husband. “It also means that you don’t have to walk to Fairbanks!”
Half an hour later, Miss Cecelia was sufficiently brought up to speed on the state of the world, had mourned the news of Dani’s passing, and readily agreed to let Caleb and Griz take her station wagon. She also accepted the Winters’ invite to stay with them and promised she would help take care of Dani’s baby.
“It’s the least we could do for his mother, poor soul,” she declared.
Rachel’s heart was overwhelmed with gratitude at this amazing gift of providence. She raced up the stairs to make sure Caleb hadn’t forgotten anything, saw their boxes of love letters, and impulsively grabbed all the notes she’d written for him to read while he was in Siberia. If he was traveling by foot, she never could have justified even an extra ounce of non-essentials, but now that God had provided him with a vehicle, she wanted Caleb to have this gift to remember how much they had — and still did — love each other.
Her eyes fell on one more memento in the box, and smiling to herself she shoved it in with the love notes. Lifting up prayers of praise and thanksgiving to Jehovah Jireh, the God who really does provide, Rachel raced downstairs, a lightness in her soul she doubted she would ever experience again.
Today had started with a funeral and a good-bye she thought might rip her very soul into shards. But now that her husband’s journey could be measured in days and not weeks, now that she knew he wouldn’t be outside braving all the elements, she allowed her heart to hope that before anything else could go wrong, her entire family would be home safe and sound, together again.
Yes, it would be hard to watch Caleb and Griz pull out of that driveway. Yes, their journey was still long, and they still had no idea if Yaya was safe or how he would find her once he got to the campus.
But as long as Rachel had this hope to hold onto, she knew her feet were planted on a firm foundation, and her family could face whatever might come their way.
 


PART TWO

“When you pass through the waters, I will be with you;
and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you;
when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
and the flame shall not consume you.
For I am the Lord your God,
the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.”

Isaiah 43:2-3
 


15. THE JOURNEY

Only a few precious hours of daylight remained by the time Caleb and Griz finished loading the station wagon and climbed in. Staring out the passenger window, Caleb watched all the familiar landmarks of home disappear, his mind racing as fast as their car as he considered everything they might have forgotten to pack.
If he kept his thoughts focused solely on the long journey ahead of them, he could try to squelch his fears for the family he was leaving behind.
Was it right for him to abandon Rachel and Tic to try to save his daughter? Caleb had read the parable of the lost sheep hundreds of times, but he never thought about the helpless flock that was left behind. Unguarded. Exposed to the elements.
Vulnerable to vicious and violent attacks.
True to his nature, Griz was completely silent, leaving Caleb alone with his doubts and regrets and anxiety.
The first stop would be Griz’s cabin so they could grab the cold-weather survival gear he’d accumulated during his career as an arctic warfare specialist. Caleb had never been on this secluded way before, and as Griz drove down what seemed to be a completely abandoned road, he hoped to God their stop wouldn’t add too much time to their journey.
Tucked up against his hip, Caleb stored treasures from home — a manila envelope full of love letters Rachel wrote while he was on a mission trip in Russia, the mixtape from their wedding playlist, and an old pocket New Testament Tic had won in fourth grade. He had memorized more verses than anyone else in Miss Cecelia’s Sunday school class, and as they were saying goodbye, Tic gave it to Caleb to take with him on the road. 
Caleb’s eyes burned with the heat of unshed tears, and he glanced at the dashboard clock, uncertain if it was correct or not. It seemed as if they had been bouncing along this driveway for the past twenty minutes, and every twist in the road without a cabin in sight made him even more anxious. Their plan was to meet the ham radio operator in Delta Junction before dark. Buster had offered the two men shelter for the night and, even more importantly, the chance to relay a message back home to Rachel to let her know they had completed the first stretch of their journey safely. 
But Fort Greely had suffered the same type of assault as Fairbanks, and the town had already erupted into bursts of violence. The stores were looted, with rumors of gunfights over snowmachines or old vehicles that were still running. Buster warned them in no uncertain terms that they were welcome to come in the day, but if he heard a vehicle pull up at night, he was coming out with his shotgun. Like just about any old-time Alaskan sourdough, Buster was a shoot-first, ask-questions-later kind of homesteader.
With night falling in a couple hours and treacherous winter roads ahead, Caleb and Griz couldn’t afford even the slightest delay.
Griz finally slowed the car down, but his cabin was surrounded by dense woods and so small Caleb almost had to squint to see it. Before he stepped outside, Griz glanced at the back seat. “Need more space in here.”
When packing, then men had left plenty of room in the trunk for Griz’s cold-weather gear, and Caleb wasn’t a fan of last-minute changes to well-established plans. “What for?” he asked.
“Arsenal.” 
Well, that was as good a reason as any. Caleb would be thankful to have more weapons than just his AR-10 and .44 Magnum all the journey with them, so if that required taking a few minutes to resituate the gear they had already packed, he wasn’t going to complain.
“You need a hand?” Caleb called out as Griz headed toward his home.
Griz didn’t even turn around. “Just more room.”
Caleb got out the station wagon, braced himself against the wind, and began moving things around in the back seat. He had gotten used to the heat on full blast and had to admit that Rachel was right. Trying to make this journey on foot would have been a grave mistake. Thank God for Miss Cecelia’s ancient station wagon and the old woman’s only slightly begrudging display of generosity.
After a few minutes, Griz returned and began hefting duffel bags and camping gear into the trunk. After all the fuss he’d made about Caleb clearing space in the back seat, he ended up not using any of it. Caleb wondered if their entire trip would be like this, with Griz effectively mute except for making the occasional demand that didn’t even make sense when all was said and done.
Even after he finished packing, Griz made no move to return to the vehicle. 
“Is that all?” Caleb finally asked, anxious to get back on the road and to Buster’s before night came.
“One minute.” Griz turned and stared at the woods, so stoic and reflective that Caleb wondered if he was reciting some kind of prayer. 
The two men never really talked about faith or spirituality. Once or twice a year, Griz would show up at church, usually right around Christmas and Easter. He was also connected to his Alaska Native heritage. Maybe this moment of silence was some sort of ritual or blessing before the men set out their journey. Caleb wasn’t sure if Griz was praying to the God of the Bible or his own ancestors, but he hoped it was the former.
After another moment of painful and awkward silence, Caleb heard trampling in the snow. A moment later, the largest malamute he had ever seen — so massive it could have been a wolf if not for the harness and collar he wore — charged straight toward them. Sensing the animal was ready to jump, Caleb steadied himself and tensed his muscles to prepare for a 150-pound impact. But the dog came to a full stop just before plowing into Griz, then sat down at his feet and looked up at him patiently, his majestic tail swishing behind him.
“Let’s go, Arsenal.” 
The malamute jumped into the back, and Griz lowered himself into the passenger seat, his only indication he was ready to trade driving duties.
A minute later, with Griz’s enormous panting dog drooling over his shoulder, Caleb was behind the wheel and making his way down Griz’s long and winding gravel road, toward the Richardson Highway and his daughter.

***

By the time Caleb and Griz crossed the Gulkana River, the sky was starting to turn that hazy shade of grayish-pink, an Alaskan twilight that would last for hours before the day turned to full night. When they passed the sign for the native village of Gulkana, Caleb thought about his students who lived here, the families he had known, many for a decade or longer. Arsenal whined once at the window as the village vanished in the rearview mirror.
On the Richardson Highway, two ravens were pecking at the snow, but Caleb couldn’t see what kind of trash or roadkill they were scavenging. His one focus was to get to Delta by nightfall. To reach Buster and his ham radio. To let Rachel know they’d reached the halfway point safely. Because Caleb knew she’d be waiting. 
On one hand, Rachel was the strongest woman he’d ever met. Serving at church, working with her clients, or caring for her family, Caleb’s wife was a steady force who led with a gentle grace, respected and admired by everyone in her orbit. What they didn’t know was the dark, the heaviness that could overcome her. With the world in chaos and their daughter unaccounted for, would she fall back into that bleak despair? For the thousandth time since they’d left home, Caleb wondered if he’d made the most foolish decision of his life.
“So how old is Arsenal?” Caleb asked, desperate to distract himself from the chaotic turmoil swirling around in his brain.
“Don’t know.”
If Caleb expected that committing to a long and dangerous journey together would make Griz more talkative, he was sorely mistaken.
“Where’d you get him?”
“Found his leg broke in one of my traps. Freed him, set his leg, and now the bastard won’t leave me alone.”
Caleb thought he might detect a hint of affection in Griz’s tone, but couldn’t be sure. “So is he a malamute or a wolf?”
Griz shrugged, and that was the end of their conversation. Arsenal, however, must have sensed he was being talked about, because he let out a loud yawn that turned into a halfhearted howl, then dropped his head on Caleb’s shoulder, where he proceeded to drool.
For a minute, Caleb wondered if the silence would get less awkward traveling with Arsenal up front and Griz in the back, but he wasn’t about to make the suggestion. He knew what a sacrifice this trip represented for Griz. What a true act of friendship it was. 
If only his traveling companion wasn’t so aloof …
“Hey, I have an idea.” Caleb gestured to the manila envelope Rachel had given him. “There’s a CD in here. An honest-to-God, real-life compact disc. Put it in. Let’s see if the sound system still works in this old beater.”
Griz had either never held a CD in his life or had completely forgotten how to use one. After Caleb showed him which side was up, Griz tried to slide Rachel’s mix tape into the slot, but something kept blocking it.
“Look for a button that says ‘eject’ or something like that,” Caleb said, not wanting to take his eyes off the road. The wind had picked up, driving horizontal sheets of snow across the highway.
There was a soft mechanical whir, and Griz pulled out the CD that had been jammed in Miss Cecelia’s player.
“Amy Grant?” Caleb let out a chuckle. “I haven’t heard her music in decades. Here.” Caleb picked up the CD Griz had unceremoniously laid face down on the dashboard and hoped it wasn’t scratched. “Slide this in, and we’ll have some music for the road.”
By the time they reached the historic Meier’s Lake Roadhouse, Caleb had relived dozens of memories with Rachel: their first dance, the jubilant celebration at their wedding reception, the long journeys they used to take back when gas was cheap and road trips were their favorite way to spend quality time together. This very same mixtape had accompanied them on their move from Anchorage to Glennallen after her father died and she inherited her childhood home, and later on all the doctor appointments to and from Glennallen and eventually the hospital where Yaya and then Tic were born.
As the Richardson began its gentle curve around Paxson Lake, Caleb was swallowing down a lump in his throat while listening to Faithfully. He didn’t even make it through the entire first verse before he had to turn the CD off. The blowing snow was blinding enough. 
He didn’t need teary eyes to make it worse.
Born and raised in Alaska, Caleb had driven through every type of hazardous condition the state had to offer. But the low visibility combined with the icy road and the stress of the last two days made his eyes strain and his shoulders ache as he clenched the steering wheel. He gritted his teeth so hard his jaw began to ache.
At a bend in the road, his back wheels spun out on some ice. For a moment, it looked as though the station wagon was going to lose control and dive headfirst into the frozen lake. He managed to right the steering wheel and get back in his lane, but the close call left him with more adrenaline in his system than his body knew how to handle.
Griz was stoic beside him, and even Arsenal in the back seat seemed so unfazed Caleb wondered if he had imagined the entire near miss.
“Well, I guess that woke me up,” he said with a nervous chuckle.
“I’ll drive when you’re tired,” was all Griz replied.
Needing a distraction that could speak more than five words at a time, Caleb turned Rachel’s mixtape back on, vowing to skip any of the sappy songs. A moment later, he was drumming happily on the steering wheel to Whitesnake: Here I go again on my own. An appropriate anthem for any road trip, but especially one of this magnitude. 
Caleb started to sing under his breath, even though Rachel always insisted he was off-key (whatever that meant). If Griz noticed or cared, it certainly didn’t show, and by the second chorus, Caleb felt his volume rising and his worries lifting.
Going down the only road I’ve ever known.
They were making good time. At this rate, there was no reason they shouldn’t make it to Buster’s by nightfall, where a hot meal, a bed, and a radio waited for them.
He wanted to tell Rachel everything about the past two hours. She would fall in love with Griz’s dog the moment she heard about Arsenal. Just the thought of talking to her again sent pangs of longing jabbing into his ribs, making his shoulders heavy, his neck tense. And there were so many things Caleb had forgotten to tell her before he left. How beautiful she was. How it was thoughts of her, and her alone, that gave him strength to make this perilous journey. 
The music she had burned onto this CD over twenty-one years ago was now ministering to his soul in a way no worship service ever had.
Like a drifter, I was born to walk alone...
A jolt. An uneven swish of the back tires. A cramp in Caleb’s leg as he pumped the brakes, resisting the urge to slam the pedal.
The way Arsenal started to bark, alerting them to danger. 
The drop-off looming in the front window. A desperate prayer: Please, Jesus, no.
Griz reached out and his strong hands yanked the steering wheel hard to the right.
And then the slam as their bodies lurched forward and the station wagon crashed into a mountain of snow and ice. 


16. UNSETTLED

Yaya hadn’t left her professor’s side since she found him injured yesterday in the seismic lab. Even though he assured her his wound wasn’t as bad as it appeared, Yaya could hardly bring herself to sleep more than a few fitful minutes at a time, terrified his health would take a turn for the worse. 
In addition to the burn on his abdomen, Boone had somehow smashed his shoulder when he fell. With his calm and patient instruction, he’d talked Yaya through the steps to make him a splint. She had also grabbed him some spare pillows Lilly brought back from the dorm, and when he wasn’t too tired, she helped him prop himself up and they sat on the floor and talked.
She told Boone about everything going on in Fairbanks — the dorm fires, the bombing rumors, the exploding cell phones (with which he had unfortunate firsthand experience). Maybe it was because he was older and more mature, but he was the only other person holed up in the GI building who didn’t want to relive their collective trauma or spend every waking moment indulging in wild speculations about current events.
Her friend Lilly, when she wasn’t trying to shove bagged cafeteria food down Yaya’s throat, spent her time rehashing the moment of her roommate’s death. Others there seemed to think they were in a competition to determine who could come up with the most politically charged or terrifying reason for the attacks in the first place.
A couple of the students were convinced Russia had made good on their threat to take Alaska back. Any moment, they expected to see Soviet-era tanks rolling through their campus. A few science majors suggested a massive solar disturbance, which could explain the electronics and (with a dizzying amount of mental gymnastics) perhaps the exploding cell phones. But their theory certainly couldn’t account for the bases getting bombed, so they proposed some type of meteor strike coupled with a solar storm.
Ozzie, the boy with dyed hair, was the only one who mentioned aliens, though Yaya couldn’t even begin to guess if he was joking or not.
Boone wasn’t like the rest of them. Maybe it was because he had more life experience. Maybe he was doing it as a favor to Yaya because he knew her brain couldn’t cope with the pointlessness of vain conjecture. But when he sat up in the little makeshift hospital bed she’d provided for him, he’d look straight into her eyes and ask her things about home.
“You mentioned you have a little brother. How old is he?”
“Sixteen.” Yaya let her mind drift. If she just shut her eyes for a moment and listened hard enough, she could hear the sound of Tic clanging weights in their basement back home.
“Are you two close?” Boone asked.
“A little.” This type of questioning always got Yaya tongue-tied. “We don’t have much in common, you know, but he’s my brother. So…”
By the look in his eyes, Yaya knew Boone understood. She liked talking to her professor in this way, and liked that they were getting to know each other outside of labs and design projects and office hours.
“What about you? Any siblings?”
“No,” he answered with a sad shake of his head that made her want to reach out and heal all his wounds, both the seen and unseen. “No brothers or sisters, but I did have over a dozen aunts and uncles.” He grinned and his blue eyes twinkled. “That’s why I grew up so spoiled.”
Yaya had to chuckle. “I have a hard time picturing you as spoiled,” she admitted, then felt an unwelcome flush creep up her cheeks. She hoped Boone didn’t notice, but he caught her eye and held her gaze steadily for just a moment.
The world might be ending. The Russians might be about to invade any moment. Or maybe the devastation was caused by a solar flare or even aliens. 
The only thing Yaya knew for certain was that since she couldn’t be home with her family right now, there was no one she would rather be spending her time with than this sensitive, charming man right here.

***

Tic’s day had been so weird with the funeral and then Dad’s departure, he was surprised when Dev reminded everyone it was Sunday. It felt strange, like days of the week were things that normal people kept track of and cared about. But with a dead woman buried in their backyard and his father gone on to brave the winter elements and bring Yaya home, what did it matter if it was Sunday or Monday or the Fourth of July or February 31?
“Maybe we should hold a church service,” Mom suggested. “Tic and Benji can play the guitar.” 
It wasn’t exactly Tic’s idea of fun, but when he saw mom’s eyes light up for the first time since Dad left, he readily agreed.
A few minutes later, seated next to a stove so hot Tic had to strip down to his tank top, he and Benji were leading their families in singing. It was hard to find songs everybody knew. Miss Cecelia kept asking for old hymns, and even though Benji could kind of figure out the tune, Tic knew fewer than half the lyrics and stumbled through the chords. And a lot of the more contemporary songs he and Benji knew best were hard for everyone to join in on without lyrics projected onto a screen like at church.
All in all, their impromptu singing session would have been awkward enough without Priyah’s face turning beet red whenever she looked at Tic or without Miss Cecelia interrupting their music with a loud coughing fit any time they forgot a line to one of her favorite hymns. Dani’s baby seemed to be the only one happy no matter what was they were singing, and as Leo sat in Mrs. Singh’s lap, he waved his arms excitedly like he was trying to beat an invisible air drum. 
The mandatory singing session came to a merciful close, and Dev opened his Bible. “Well, friends.” He began in a booming voice, as if he was preaching to a church filled with hundreds instead of a living room with exactly four adults and a few kids and teens. “With the power out and God alone knowing when it’ll come back, I couldn’t think of a more appropriate passage to share with you today than Matthew 5. Taken from the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus tells us, ‘You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.’”
Dev shut his Bible and stared at each of them in turn. “God has called us to be lights in this dark time, to be cities on a hill, shining bright for all to see. Now, if the good Lord wills it, this whole ordeal might blow over soon. The power will come back on, the grid will get back up and running, and life will resume as it was before. But if it doesn’t …”
Here Dev leveled his gaze, and Tic stared at his lap, both thankful and afraid that another adult was giving voice to the fears that had been swirling around in his head all evening.
“We need to be ready for anything. Jesus told his disciples to be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves. Later on in Matthew, he tells us that neighbor will turn against neighbor and brother against brother. So before it comes down to that,” Dev continued, “we need to ask ourselves if we’re ready. Are we ready to turn the other cheek? Are we ready to hand over our cloak when someone demands our tunic?”
Tic’s mind always wandered when anybody but his dad was teaching about the Bible, but now he was absorbed in Dev’s words — not because he believed them, but because he doubted.
“If God has given us food,” Dev went on, “we must be willing to share it with anyone who asks. If God has given us warmth and shelter, we must be ready to open up the doors to our home and let the strangers in.”
Tic shot a glance at his mother while their friend spoke about their house as if it were his to offer up to any passerby. Tic understood charity and hospitality. He understood neighbors helping neighbors. That’s why Miss Cecelia was here. That’s why the Singhs were here. That’s why Griz had agreed to go with Dad on a trip he had no obligation to take to bring home Tic’s sister whom he barely knew.
But when crap hit the fan, as his dad would euphemistically put it, who was going to defend their home from attack? Who was going to protect their food supply and their shelter and their safety? The way Dev was talking, if an armed man showed up right now on the porch and demanded room and board, the Winters were biblically bound to take him in. Not only that, but while some random stranger stole their food they were also supposed to offer him their water and their blankets and their ammo as well.
That’s not how Tic had been raised. And that’s certainly not how he planned to react if the time came that people in Glennallen really did start turning against each other.
Before he left, Dad had entrusted Tic with the solemn obligation to protect his mom and protect their home. And — Golden Rule or not — Tic didn’t plan to let anything stop him.

***

Rachel couldn’t adequately express how much Dev’s sermon had meant to her. For one thing, it got her away from the radio, if only for a few minutes. Even though it was still too early for Caleb to have arrived in Delta, she still checked in with Buster on the hour like clockwork and desperately needed a distraction.
As Dev led the closing prayer for their impromptu church service, she felt the burden of the day lift off her shoulders. Dev’s words had reminded her more than anything else to count her blessings. They had food. They had heat. They had each other.
And even with Caleb gone, she knew there were still plenty of reasons to praise the Lord. Her husband was heading to Fairbanks by car, thanks to Miss Cecelia’s station wagon, so old-fashioned it was one of the only pieces of technology that hadn’t crashed along with the rest of the world. He and Griz had made plans to spend the night with Buster, the radio operator outside of Delta, which meant that they wouldn’t be cold and also meant that Rachel would hear from her husband tonight before she went to bed.
Of course, she wished that none of this had happened in the first place, that Dani hadn’t died, that Caleb hadn’t left, that the world hadn’t collapsed into chaos. There were so many things that could be better than they were. 
But then again, they could be so much worse.
Rachel thought about all those in Glennallen who relied solely on heating fuel to make it through the winter. What would happen to them if the power wasn’t restored? Dev’s sermon tonight had made her both pensive and convicted. She had told God multiple times today how thankful she was for their wood-burning stove. Did that mean she was ready to invite dozens of acquaintances — even strangers — into her home to share their heat?
And what about food? The people in this home could ward off hunger for several months given what they currently had in their freezers and pantries. They would have to get creative with their meal-prepping (Rachel had a feeling that Angel could teach her a thing or two about that), but even if they got bored with beans and lentils, their food would last them through the winter and into spring when they could start thinking about gardening and foraging, not to mention hunting and fishing.
But Dev’s words — no, God’s words, really — continued to bounce around in Rachel’s head long after their closing prayer. What if another young mom came begging for baby formula? Should Rachel give her half of their supply even if that meant baby Leo might go hungry? What if several families showed up on their porch, asking for food, even shelter? 
Should they take them all in, even if that meant they’d run out of supplies before spring?
No matter what Dev said, Rachel knew her primary responsibility was to her family and to the individuals gathered right now in her home. Taking in friends and neighbors was one thing. Complete strangers off the streets? She didn’t want to say never and find herself arguing with God, but hadn’t Dev’s sermon started with a warning to be shrewd as serpents?
Best-case scenario, something magical would happen and the power would come back on. Caleb and Griz would bring Yaya home, and she’d whine and complain about them being overprotective and beg to go back to school. Nobody would have to worry about running out of food or taking in random vagabonds, because life might go back to normal.
And if it didn’t… well, those were questions Rachel would have to face another day.

***

Caleb stepped out of the car, thankful to no longer breathe in nothing but airbag dust. His body was so flooded with adrenaline and his nerves so consumed by fear and frustration that he scarcely noticed the cold. After brushing himself off, he leaned in to check more closely on his friend.
Griz’s airbag (if it even existed in a car this old) hadn’t deployed, and there was a large cut on his forehead. “I’m fine,” was all he said. Caleb was too dazed to jump into an argument about first aid with him and tried not to wince when Arsenal started licking the blood off his owner’s face.
Griz’s door was smashed up against a mountain of snow, so he had to get himself out through the driver side. “Stay,” he told Arsenal, who looked dejected and abandoned but still obeyed.
 The men stood shoulder to shoulder, and for several moments neither spoke. The front passenger side of the car was buried under the snowbank that had broken their spin. They’d have to clear a way to get to the hood and measure the extent of the damage.
Griz put on his winter gear, picked up the snow shovel he’d packed, and immediately, silently, set to work. Caleb rummaged around in the back seat, trying his best to avoid Arsenal’s drool and hot breath, until he found a small collapsible shovel Miss Cecelia kept. He began digging out the wheels while Griz focused on clearing the snow that had collapsed around the hood.
“You need gloves,” Griz stated.
Caleb knew he was right, but he refused to slow down. Rachel would already be waiting by the radio right now, frantic to hear from them. Delta was still an hour and a half away — if you were lucky enough to own a working vehicle — and the daylight wouldn’t last.
Thoughts of his wife and son back home, his daughter so many hundreds of miles ahead of him, fueled Caleb’s resolve. He was tossing snow behind him twice as fast as Griz, but since his collapsible shovel was so comically small, he had very little to show for his exertion other than sweat that immediately turned to steam as it rose from his exposed skin.
“Gloves,” Griz repeated.
“I will in a minute.” Caleb couldn’t slow down, couldn’t stop working. His family depended on him.
“I’m not treating you for frostbite.” There was no hint of teasing or irony in Griz’s tone.
Caleb let the little plastic shovel fall, climbed back into the station wagon, and reluctantly pulled on his hat and gloves. Arsenal took the opportunity to jump out of the car, sniff both back tires, and let out a long stream of steaming urine right where Caleb had been working.
“Look at that. If we give him enough to drink, he can melt all the snow away and we’ll be out of here in no time.”
Griz didn’t respond to Caleb’s attempt at a joke. Instead, the man continued working in silence. 
Caleb’s breath frosted onto his beard, but he didn’t feel the cold. Right now would be a perfect time to pray. A perfect time to ask God for favor, to help them get the station wagon free, to ensure the engine hadn’t been irreparably damaged in the crash. But he was too riddled with anxiety, his body still flooded with cortisol, his brain too jostled to form any cohesive thought, let alone an actual prayer. All he could hope was that God would look down and see his struggle and somehow interpret his beads of sweat, his stinging face, and his pants of exertion as a cry for help.
As the pink and gray twilight turned to the almost colorless violet that appears just before complete darkness, Griz shoveled snow off the crumpled hood of the station wagon, then popped it open. Caleb paused shoveling long enough to hear his assessment.
“Cracked coolant hose.”
Caleb could barely register the words. There was only one question on his mind. “Will it drive?”
Griz was silent for far too long before finally tramping through the snow and popping open the trunk. “Need duct tape.”
If duct tape could fix whatever damage the station wagon suffered in the crash, maybe they weren’t in such bad shape after all. 
Griz tinkered under the hood. Caleb kept shoveling around the tires so once they got the car running they could pull it out of the snowbank. From time to time, Arsenal would get bored staring out at the vast winter landscape. Then he would join Caleb in digging for a few minutes before sitting back on his haunches to keep solemn vigil over the setting sun yet again.
“Try the engine.”
Griz’s words were like music to Caleb’s ears. The only sweeter sound would be that of the engine turning over and roaring to life when he hopped into the driver side and turned the key in the ignition.
Nothing.
“Need paracord,” Griz announced, and started digging around the trunk.
Caleb couldn’t guess how long they’d been working, but there was no way the remaining sunlight would last them all the way to Delta. Even if they miraculously got back on the road in the next five minutes, there was no way they’d make it to Buster’s home tonight.
And that was only if they got the car working. He couldn’t even guess what would become of them if they didn’t. So he stepped back out into the chilly evening and fell into a solemn rhythm freeing the tires.
Caleb hadn’t shoveled snow in years, not since he got the plow extension for the truck and Tick got strong enough to take over clearing the porch and the walkways. The physical exertion gave his mind a tangible goal to focus on, but the stinging in his lungs and the exhaustion already setting into his muscles did nothing but remind him that Rachel was right. This was a journey he could not make on foot. They had to get the car running.
Please, God, was the only prayer he could form.
“Again,” Griz ordered, but as hard as Caleb prayed before turning the key, nothing happened.
It didn’t make sense. When Miss Cecelia showed up that morning, it felt as if God himself had created a station wagon out of ice and snow and miraculously plunked it down onto the Winters’ driveway. If it hadn’t been for that gift of providence, the men would have taken a full day walking to Griz’s to gather the rest of their supplies. Day two would have gotten them no farther than Gulkana. The station wagon had already saved them four or five days of walking just to get them this far.
God wouldn’t have provided this gift so miraculously just to have it fail them so early in their journey.
Would he?
The two men continued their dance of insanity, Griz tinkering under the hood for a few minutes, Caleb popping behind the wheel and holding his breath and wishing to heaven for the engine to work.
It never did. 
Arsenal let out a loud, mournful howl as the last vestiges of light disappeared, and Caleb tried hard not to think about his wife back home, sitting desperately by the radio, wondering where her husband was. Knowing her propensity to worry, he explained to her that if they didn’t reach Buster’s before dark they’d end up spending the night in the station wagon. But that wouldn’t be enough to calm Rachel’s nerves, not on a night like this.
And so he turned his thoughts toward Yaya, reminding himself why he and Griz had started out on this hazardous journey in the first place. If God hadn’t provided Miss Cecelia’s station wagon, they’d still be just a few miles away from home and spending the night in one of Griz’s cold-climate tents.
“Again.” Griz’s voice was a welcome interruption to his spiraling thoughts.
Caleb’s hand was shaking, maybe from cold or maybe from nerves, when on the third attempt the engine sputtered. The roar of the engine was a glorious ruckus that only a gas guzzler this old could make, as welcome to Caleb’s ears as oxygen to a drowning man’s lungs.
Caleb let out a triumphant hoot and exultantly stepped out of the car, leaving the engine running. “You did it!”
The barest trace of a smile spread over Griz’s lips.

***

The station wagon’s clock, so much as it could be trusted, read quarter after seven by the time Griz and Caleb got the engine running. As soon as they were both out of the cold, Griz insisted they change their socks. 
After a few minutes, once he could feel some circulation again in his hands, Caleb took off his gloves and rummaged around in his backpack for the jerky Rachel had packed for them. He and Griz split the small package, both sharing a few pieces with an enthusiastically demanding Arsenal. In spite of how little he’d eaten that day, Caleb barely had an appetite.
The engine worked, thanks to some duct tape holding the cracked coolant hose together, but the tires were still stuck in a five-foot snow drift. With night on them, it was pointless trying to shovel out more snow. They were stuck here for the night. They couldn’t run the heater indefinitely, but if they turned it on at intervals they could hopefully keep themselves and the engine from completely freezing.
Caleb hated the idea of even a moment’s delay. He tried to think of anything else besides Rachel waiting desperately at home. This was the normal time on a Sunday evening when the two of them would be wrapping up youth group. He’d been so worried about his own immediate family today that he had scarcely spared energy to think about the extended members of his community — Pastor Tom and other elders at the church, his colleagues at the school, all the students in his classroom and youth group he had devoted so much of his life to.
Everybody must be just as lost and as worried as he was, but instead of that bringing him any sense of connectedness with the world, he felt even more overwhelmed. What right did he have to complain that he couldn’t reach Rachel tonight on the radio when they had buried their friend Dani just this morning? 
What about his students without a way to heat their homes or any extra food? 
At least he and Griz had a source of heat and a trunk full of cold weather supplies. What did Yaya have, and those with her up in Fairbanks? Coats and a blanket or two, hopefully shelter of some sort. And then what?
In any other emergency of this magnitude, victims could expect FEMA and the Red Cross to show up, maybe not instantaneously all the way out in rural Alaska, but pretty darn close if you were in a city like Fairbanks. But what good was FEMA when the entire federal government was crippled — perhaps obliterated? Rumors abounded on the radio channels about multiple bases in the Lower 48 attacked just like the ones in Fairbanks and Delta. And how could the Red Cross mobilize without working phones or running vehicles?
Dreadful as it was to admit, Yaya and the other young students she was with were very much on their own. Unless help arrived, they would have to fend for themselves against the elements, the fear, and the urban dangers Caleb refused to let his mind even contemplate.
The frost on Caleb’s beard had scarcely started melting when Griz reached out and killed the engine. “Can’t risk overheating.”
Caleb was too mentally exhausted to argue.
A few minutes later, Griz had stretched his seat as far back as it would go. Arsenal, seizing the opportunity, climbed on top of his chest and began play-nibbling his ear then tucked his head into Griz’s armpit in a gesture that seemed quite familiar to them both.
Caleb’s arms ached to hold his wife. Heck, he’d even enjoy some cuddles from Cammy right now, as much as the spaniel could annoy him with her vibrating tail stump and propensity to whine whenever she felt any extreme emotion.
“I’ll take the first shift to make sure it doesn’t get too cold in here,” Caleb offered. To keep the oil from seizing up, one of them would have to stay awake, ready to run the engine.
Griz grunted, and judging by the sound of the calm regular breathing that followed, he was fast asleep. Arsenal, considering his job complete, returned to the back seat and curled up like a donut.
Caleb pulled a small flashlight out of his coat pocket. If he were being as cautious as he should, he wouldn’t waste even a few seconds of its battery power, but he was miles away from home and hours away from sleep. 
He opened the manila envelope Rachel had given him when they said their last goodbyes, pulled out the first page, and took in his wife’s words.
Dearest, darlingest Caleb,
Right now when you are reading this, you are probably on a plane flying to Russia on a trip to serve God and encourage those you come across. I just want you to know that I love you so much, that I am so thankful to be engaged to a man as strong and godly and selfless as you, a man who has devoted his life to spreading the gospel to the farthest corners of the earth and serving others with the love of Christ.
The words sent pangs of ice and regret shooting through Caleb’s heart. When he and Rachel first met and fell in love over their shared passion for the gospel, they had talked about all the ways God might use them in their future. And in many ways, he had. There was the mission trip they both took to Kobuk in the Alaskan bush to run summer youth camps and VBS. Then years of parenting and youth ministry, serving the Lord together side by side, ministering in their church …
But was this what Rachel and he pictured when they committed their lives to God and to each other? It seemed like there was supposed to be so much more in store for them …
Darling, this will be the first time since you told me that you loved me that we will have gone a single day without seeing each other, gazing into each other’s eyes, praying together and worshiping our wonderful Lord and Savior side by side. But I don’t want to dwell right now on how hard it is going to be, because I don’t want you to regret your decision to follow the Lord wherever he may lead you. I don’t want to tell you how desperately I am going to miss you, because I don’t want you to be distracted from the work he set before you. The next two weeks will be excruciating to be separated from the one true love of my entire life, my heart and my soul, but I am so proud to be loved by and pledged to a man who will follow God no matter what, a man whose heart is so selfless and so devoted to spreading God’s word.
I know that this journey, yes, even this separation we are facing, is part of God’s plan for both you and me. In the same way, I hope you know just as confidently and faithfully how much I love and adore you, and I will be praying for you nonstop from this moment until you return back home and I am back in your arms once more, right where I belong.
Caleb let out a sound that could only be described as a moan. 
Arsenal glanced up, then stretched out to tentatively lick Caleb’s trembling hand. His beloved had written this letter over two decades ago, but she may as well have penned it last night.  


17. TINY DANCER

“This is Rachel Winters from Glennallen.” Her hand trembled as she held down the talk button.
A burst of static, and then the strong voice she had grown accustomed to hearing on the other end.
“Buster here, Rachel. Still no sign of your husband or his friend. I’m sorry.”
Rachel glanced at the clock. Caleb and Griz should have arrived in Delta hours ago. Something must have happened…
“Do you think they made it to Delta and maybe got lost?” she asked.
Seated on the couch across from her, Miss Cecelia alternated between bouncing baby Leo on her knee and casting furtive, sympathetic glances in Rachel’s direction. Why couldn’t the old woman give her some privacy? Everyone else had. Tic and Benji were in the basement lifting weights. Dev had taken Priya into the garage, something to do with an old Canon camera she’d found in a box of candles, but Rachel had been too mentally exhausted to care and simply nodded when they asked for permission to dig around more to hunt for film. Angel and Priyah were in the office, their quiet voices occasionally drifting down the hallway. 
Everybody else had found something else to do. Why couldn’t Miss Cecelia? 
“I gave them pretty good instructions,” Buster said. “Doubt they’re lost. Best thing you can do is try to get yourself some sleep. Call back in the morning when it’s light.”
“But why haven’t they gotten there yet?” Rachel had to know. Had to get answers. Had to get herself away from Miss Cecelia’s smothering attention.
Buster paused before replying. “Coulda been anything, really. Try not to worry. I been near this radio all day. Nobody’s called in to mention any type of accident or nothing like that. Most likely, they just got a little delayed, that’s all. And I told them they couldn’t come poking around after dark, so I’d do your best to save your battery power and we’ll talk in the morning when the sun’s up.”
It would almost be easier for her if Buster weren’t so kind and patient. If Rachel sensed he was annoyed by her frantic worry, it might not hurt so much. 
“But if you see him before them, you’ll tell him I called?” 
She wasn’t ready to turn off the radio yet. Wasn’t ready to face a restless night without any idea where her husband was. Was he hurt? What if there was an accident? What if something went wrong with the car? 
What if Caleb was already dead?
“I’ll tell him,” Buster answered gently. “Now I gotta leave this channel open for others, Rachel. You know that.”
“I know. I know.” Her face felt hot.
“I’ll tell him you called,” Buster repeated.
“And you’ll tell him I love him?” Her voice came out like a squeak.
From the speaker, she could hear Buster’s small sigh. “Of course. I’ll tell him that, too.”

“Dude, I think you got some kind of zombie toe,” Benji exclaimed when Tic took off his socks to practice his deadlifts.
Tic glanced down. It had been hurting earlier, but he hadn’t paid it any attention in hours. He shrugged. “Just a hangnail.”
“Janky.”
“Yeah, Mom said it’s getting infected.”
Even Cammy seemed interested in giving Tic’s foot a few perfunctory sniffs before curling up in the corner and beginning the process of tearing the fabric off a tennis ball.
Tic had more important things to worry about right now than what was going on with his foot. Like where Dad was. He should have radioed in from Delta hours ago. But since nobody had any clue what happened to him, Tic was going to overload his brain (and his muscles) by attempting a personal record on his deadlift. Benji stood to the side doing lateral raises with some fifteen-pound dumbbells, but Tic was going for the heavy weights.
Anything to keep his mind distracted.
Tic walked up to the loaded barbell, toes angled, heels planted firmly on his mat. Hitting 385 on deadlift would give him his second PR of the week. 
Getting himself in place, he ran himself through the form and safety checklist Dad had ingrained in him from their earliest days lifting together. Big belly breath, straight back, bar touching the shins, neutral spine. 
He was ready. 
This lift is for you, Dad. A strong inhale, then Tic pulled with all his might. Slowly, painfully, fighting for each centimeter, he lifted the bar off the floor. His muscles locked into place, but a tremor ran through his legs as they strained to hold both his body and the weights steady. Then that brutal moment when the bar hovered mid-thigh and his muscle fibers twitched and screamed for release. That brutal moment when he had to decide: 
Drop it all now, or keep going?
He pictured his father, who up until today had been present for every single one of Tic’s PRs. You can do it, son, he seemed to say.
And Tic knew his dad was right. He could do it. His muscles were poised, eager, ready to make those last few inches. Tic could visualize the movement. Accomplish the flow in his sleep. One last burst of exertion to drive his hips forward. He felt the pull in every cell, every muscle fiber, every ounce of willpower. 
He locked out the bar and let the breath he’d been holding explode out his lungs. The bar clanged to the ground, as competing surges of both dopamine and fatigue flooded Tic’s body.
It was a huge accomplishment. But he couldn’t enjoy it. 
Not without Dad here. That lift hadn’t meant anything. He slumped onto the bench, his head light, his quads and thigh muscles twitching.
“Dude, you wimp out?” Benji asked. 
Tic just shrugged. He’d rather have his friend believe he’d exhausted himself on the mat than confess the truth. Hitting a PR without his dad here felt like a betrayal, one he regretted the instant he locked his hips in place.
Benji was staring at him. “You straight, bro?” he asked.
Tic nodded. “Yeah, I’m good.”
“If you say so.”
There was a soft knock on the basement door, and Tic was surprised to see Mrs. Singh there, holding a candle and looking worried.
“Tic, can I talk to you for a moment?”
“Sure.” He reached down and began to pull his socks back on.
“I’m a little worried about your mom,” Mrs. Singh admitted.
Tic’s heart sank. Aside from news that his father was dead or that Fairbanks had been completely obliterated by nukes, it was the last thing he wanted to hear. All evening, Tic had watched his mom shrink and wilt with each passing minute until he was afraid the clock would eventually strike midnight and she’d turn to dust and ash. Coming down here to lift was his last-ditch effort to get his mind on something else. But if Mrs. Singh was worried, that meant Mom was not okay. 
And he had promised Dad he’d make sure she was okay.
Tic didn’t know how to respond, but sensing he was expected to come up with some sort of reply, he asked, “Is she sick?”
“She’s just really worried about your dad. I’ve told her she should try to get some rest. The radio man said nobody was coming in after dark, so there’s nothing she can do tonight. I thought maybe you could …” 
Mrs. Singh didn’t have to finish her thought. Tic was already halfway up the basement stairs, Cammy at his heels.
In the living room, Mom was in the same spot she’d sat in for hours, staring out the window at a whole lot of nothing and clutching the radio in her lap. 
It wasn’t even turned on.
“Mom?”
She turned around with a start, her eyes vacant.
“Mom?” he repeated. She couldn’t have aged this much in a day, could she? Then why hadn’t Tic noticed all those wrinkles before? Even her long hair looked more gray than black. It must be a trick from the candlelight. 
“Hey, honey.” Mom stretched out her arms toward him, and even though it made him feel like a baby, he sat down beside her and leaned into her chest while she rested her cheek on the top of his head. Cammy joined her on the other side, nestling her head beneath Mom’s free arm.
“How’s my guy?” Mom asked.
“I’m fine.” He resisted the urge to pull away when he heard Benji coming up the stairs. “But I’m worried about you. It’s getting late, you know.”
“Oh, I know, sweetie. I was just waiting to hear if there’s any news.”
“Your radio’s not even on.”
Mom looked down at the machine. “Oh.”
“Come on.” Tic held her by the elbow and tried to raise her to her feet. “It’s late. You should go to sleep, unless you’re gonna stay here by the fire.”
Mom’s voice was like that of a small child waiting to be tucked in. “No, I guess I’ll go to bed.”
Hearing the word, Cammy ran to the foot of the stairs then glanced back to wait, half a tennis ball in her mouth, tail stump wagging.
“Mom, leave that down here.” Tic tried to take her hands off the clunky ham radio, but she held onto it with an iron grip. “Your father might call.”
“He can’t, Mom.” He gently pried her fingers away. “He probably just got to Delta later than he expected. Tomorrow he’ll give you a call.”
Mom let out her breath and nodded. “Yeah, that’s probably right. But maybe I should stay down here with it, just in case...” She reached out again for the radio, but Tic took her arm and linked it in his. 
Leading her toward the stairs, he just said, “I think it’s time to try to sleep, don’t you?”
Mom turned to look at him, staring directly into his soul. Tic had no idea that two human eyes could contain so much desperation. “He’ll be all right, won’t he?” Mom leaned her weight on him, as if the wrong answer might drop her to the floor.
Tic cleared his throat and forced confidence into his voice. “Yeah, Mom. Remember,” he repeated, “he’s with Griz. What can go wrong?”

***

Rachel jumped out of bed with a start. What was that noise?
She had a vague recollection of Tic helping her into bed earlier as if she were in a drug-induced stupor, but now her senses were sharp.
The low hum, a sound she’d grown accustomed to in the past couple days, was now joined by an ominous growl. But it wasn’t coming from outside.
Cammy stood with her paws on the windowsill, her tail stump twitching, an uncharacteristic snarl vibrating her entire body. The dog had only made that sound a few times in her entire life. Rachel knew exactly what it meant. It meant that someone — or something — was outside.
“What is it, girl?”
She peered out from her second-story window. The moon cast an eerie glow over the snow. She looked in the direction Cammy was staring. Was that a figure in the woods?
It wasn’t until Cammy let out an even lower, throaty growl that Rachel felt fear completely seize her body. Outside, a shadowy form was moving closer to their house.
But then she squinted to see better, and the vision completely vanished. Had she made the entire thing up?
She glanced at her husband’s gun safe, recalled his warning to protect their home while he was away. But she also remembered Dev’s sermon about giving anything to those who asked.
Which of the two men was correct?
She pried her eyes away from the safe. She was just on edge, worried for her husband, unaccustomed to sleeping alone. Perhaps Cammy had picked up on her anxiety and was growling at phantoms.
With the pounding of her pulse in her ears, Rachel thought she heard voices. Was someone awake downstairs, or was it coming from outside? Maybe she should take the gun out, just in case.
Caleb, why can’t you be here?
Rachel peered back out the window. If the power worked, the motion detectors would flood the area with light and she could tell at a glance if there was something in the woods. But now, she was almost as bad as blind. 
Blind, and scared, and entirely uncertain what to do.
Cammy jumped from her vigil at the window and whined at the door. Should Rachel let her go outside and investigate? If it was an animal out there, Cammy could scare it off. But if it was a person ...
Rachel thought she heard a noise but couldn’t tell where it was coming from. She wrapped her bathrobe around her and opened the bedroom door. She told Cammy to stay beside her while she assessed where everybody should be. 
She strained her ears. Unless baby Leo was up and fussy, nobody should be awake.
Silence from Tic’s room, the one he was sharing with Benji. She would have been thrilled to simply find the two boys up late talking like they had on so many sleepovers for so many years. But there was nothing.
Yaya’s was the only other room upstairs, but it was empty. Everybody else was sleeping downstairs closer to the heat. The Singhs were staying in Rachel’s office with a closed door and some privacy, but Miss Cecelia chose to stay in the living room with baby Leo so he could be nearest to the stove.
At the top of the stairs, Rachel wavered for another moment, listening for any noise. Cammy looked up at her, waiting. If everyone was asleep, there was no reason to bother them. 
She was about to return to her room and chastised herself for her bad case of nerves. The entire last half of Dev’s sermon that evening had been about trusting God and not giving way to anxiety, and yet here she was, worrying so hard she was surprised the sound of her pounding heart hadn’t woken everyone in the house up by now. 
Then again, Cammy had most definitely been growling at something. Maybe Rachel should go down and check.
She heard the unmistakable sound of a door opening, which sealed her resolve. As quietly but as quickly as she could, she hurried downstairs.
Miss Cecelia was fully dressed, snow boots and coat included. She had Caleb’s shotgun slung over her shoulder. She turned to face Rachel and held a finger to her lips. “I think there’s something outside,” she whispered.
Rachel couldn’t tell which she felt more — relief that she hadn’t been crazy or terror that she had been right.
“I need the strongest torch or flashlight you got,” Miss Cecelia said in her matter-of-fact way. She eyed Rachel’s bathrobe and stockinged feet. “Better bundle up, too.”
Rachel didn’t move. “Should we wake up Dev?”
Miss Cecelia snorted, coughed, then shook her head. “No. We’ll take care of this.”
Rachel eyed the shotgun. “You know how to use that?”
Miss Cecelia made another sound — halfway between a laugh and a stifled cough. “My parents homesteaded on this land before there was a pipeline, before Alaska was even a state. I can hold my own. I just need you to grab us a flashlight.”
Rachel clutched Miss Cecelia’s arm. “What if it’s a person out there?”
Miss Cecelia’s expression never changed once. “Then I hope they’ve made peace with God, ’cause even at my age, I’m a dead shot.”
“I don’t know if this is a good idea,” Rachel whispered. She felt sick to her stomach, like nothing she had eaten in the past 24 hours had been even remotely digested.
Miss Cecelia had one hand on the doorknob, the other on the shotgun. “Honey, you and the Singhs are good people, and I’m mighty thankful you’ve taken me in. Least I can do is repay the favor in this one small way. Now I’m stepping out onto the porch whether you come with me or not. And I’ll understand if you don’t have the stomach for it. I’m telling you I know how to defend my own, but I could do it a lot better if I had some light.”
Before Rachel could force herself to move or even speak, the front door burst open. Rachel let out a scream then saw it was Tic standing in the arctic entrance, his chest just inches away from the shotgun barrel.
Rachel pushed him against the door and jumped between Miss Cecelia and her son.
“Mom?”
Rachel couldn’t help it. At the sound of his voice, she started to sob. She had always hated guns, never understood that ridiculous Alaskan fixation with firearms. When the kids were little, Caleb grumbled at the way she insisted everything was locked up and stored out of reach, how the ammo had to be kept in a separate location (also locked up). 
And now, just two days into a prolonged power outage, she and ancient Miss Cecelia had almost … They could have … 
“What in the world were you doing out there at this hour?” Rachel demanded, angrily swatting away her tears. She’d much rather be furious than scared. Scared at what could have happened to her only son. The one Caleb had left her home to protect.
“I had to get something from the garage,” Tic answered defensively, eyeing the shotgun in Miss Cecelia’s hands. “Is everything okay?”
“We heard noises. And you’re lucky you came in when you did, because we were about to go out there and …” Again, tears sprang to her eyes, and she furiously worked to compose herself. Tic wouldn’t take her seriously at all if she were a blubbering mess.
She fixed her expression and demanded once more, “What were you doing out there?”
“I just …” Tic couldn’t meet her gaze. “It was nothing. I couldn’t sleep. Just forget about it.”
Forget about it? Had those words seriously just escaped her sixteen-year-old boy’s lips? He goes outside, terrifies her into thinking there’s an intruder, could have gotten himself shot and killed, and she’s supposed to forget about it? She gave him an icy glare and refused to look away.
“I’ll just put this back in its place.” Miss Cecelia tucked the shotgun back on the top shelf of the closet and excused herself. 
Rachel and Tic stood squared off in the arctic entrance. “What were you doing out there?” 
Her mind raced through all the possibilities. She and Caleb didn’t drink or smoke. As far as she knew, there wasn’t anything in the garage he could have gotten into to get in trouble. Could he have been meeting somebody? She knew he had a crush on AJ at school, but surely she wouldn’t walk three miles here in the dark and the cold to see him.
Then again …
She stared at her son’s face, looking for tell-tale signs of guilt or embarrassment or even a smudge of lipstick. Anything that could help her figure out what he had gotten into.
He was still staring at his feet when he mumbled, “I’m sorry I scared you.”
“Scared me? You could have gotten yourself …” She realized her voice had risen to a slightly hysterical level and forced herself to whisper. “You could have gotten yourself shot.”
“I was just messing around in the garage.”
“Doing what, exactly?”
Again, he couldn’t meet her gaze. “It was nothing.”
“Nothing doesn’t get a teenage boy out of bed in the middle of the night in the middle of winter in the middle of a power outage. Nothing doesn’t make so much ruckus that Miss Cecelia even without her hearing aids came out with a loaded weapon to see if someone was trying to break in.”
“I’m sorry,” he repeated, as if that were enough to make Rachel forget all her worries and go straight back to bed.
“Everything all right out here?” Dev called out from the back room where he and his wife and daughter were supposed to be sleeping.
“We’re fine,” Rachel answered. 
Great, now the Singhs would see firsthand that she couldn’t control her son.
“I’m going upstairs,” she hissed. “If you want to come up and tell me the truth and let me know what you were really doing out there tonight, you know where to find me.”
Without giving Tic another chance to obfuscate anymore or time to come up with some lie or excuse, she stormed up the stairs, furious at the ridiculousness of this entire situation. No sixteen-year-old goes out to the garage in secret at this time of night unless he’s up to no good. 
And what was she supposed to do? Ground him? From what? Playing his guitar — the only thing he possessed that hadn’t been destroyed in the outage? She flopped on her bed in a huff. She hated that she’d cried in front of him. It made her feel weak. She wasn’t weak. She was outraged. If he did anything stupid and got himself hurt …
A timid knock at the door. “Mom?”
She let out her breath, feeling her mother’s heart melt just for a moment at the sound of his contrite voice.
“Can I come in?”
“Yeah.” She let out a heavy sigh.
Tic stood at the foot of her bed, his eyes still downcast. Whatever he had to say, she needed to be ready. When the kids were little, she and Caleb had always tried to reward them for telling the truth. There may still be consequences for wrong behavior, but if they confessed right away, their punishment might not be as harsh.
No matter what happened, she needed to remember that the past two days had been just as hard on Tic as on her. The world had changed literally overnight. They had buried a friend, and their home was filled with extra bodies. They had no word from Yaya and were both worried about Caleb, both trying to keep from wondering why he hadn’t called in on the radio …
“I, um, I didn’t mean to scare you. I hope you know that.” Tic shifted his weight from one foot to another.
“Yeah, I know.”
He let out a small, nervous chuckle. “Was Miss Cecelia really going to come outside with the shotgun?”
Rachel didn’t return his laugh. “Yes.”
“Oh.” He continued to stare at the floor. “I guess that makes sense then why you were so worried.”
“I was,” she admitted. Worried. Furious. Terrified …
“Well, I know now it was a stupid idea, but I couldn’t sleep. You said something tonight at church, and I just kept thinking about it. Dev asked what each of us would miss about the old life if things don’t go back to normal soon, and you talked about not being able to listen to music whenever you wanted?”
Rachel hadn’t known what type of confession or excuse to expect when Tic came upstairs to her room, but it certainly wasn’t this.
He reached into the pocket of his hoodie and pulled out a small box. “It got me thinking,” he went on. “What you said about music? And how we can’t stream anymore and we don’t have tape players or CDs and stuff? And then I remembered seeing this in the garage, so I went out to look, and …”
He handed her a small box. “I found this for you. I thought you might like it.”
She knew exactly what it was, and if it wasn’t for how embarrassed she’d made herself by crying earlier, she might have given way to the lump in her throat and gladly released the tears that threatened to spill down her cheeks. 
She cracked the box open, and a little ballerina in a pink tutu popped up while a mechanical lullaby began to play.
“It doesn’t have batteries,” Tic told her with a beam in his eye and a hint of pride in his voice. “So I thought you could play it whenever you missed music. As long as the gears keep working, it won’t ever go bad.”
She reached out her arms and gave Tic a hug. With her cheek pressed against his shoulder, she allowed a few tears to stream down her face.
“It’s the kindest thing in the world. Where did you find it?”
“In the boxes of baby stuff. I was digging in there earlier looking for things Leo might like. I saw it then but didn’t think much about it until what you said at church. I know I should have waited for the morning, but I couldn’t sleep and …”
“It’s a perfect gift.” She turned her gaze away before she got even more emotional. 
“Just probably not perfect enough to get shot over, right?” Tic flashed her a mischievous grin.
It wasn’t a joke she thought was particularly funny, but she made herself laugh anyway, if only from relief that Tic hadn’t been in the garage doing drugs or any of the other horrible things she’d envisioned.
“So, um, in the morning I guess I’ll apologize to Miss Cecelia too?”
“That’s not a bad idea. I’m just glad you’re safe. And as scared as I got, I do love my gift. Thank you so much.”
“You’re welcome.”
“Now you better try to get some sleep,” Rachel said.
“I’ll try.” Tic leaned over and gave her one more hug. “Good night, Mom.”
“Good night, sweetie.”

***

Caleb woke up with that groggy sensation of a dream that vanishes a moment before you can summon it to your full awareness. 
Rachel had been there. He remembered that much, knew that was why he felt a sense of lingering peace before the chill and the ache in his bones and body fully set in.
He jerked himself awake, terrified that he had slept for too long and let the engine freeze. Without a block heater, if the cold made the oil too thick to circulate, the car that had taken so long yesterday to repair would be a total loss.
Somewhere in the back of his mind, he had a vague recollection of Griz’s gruff voice speaking to him in the middle of the night with uncharacteristic gentleness, telling him to get some sleep. Still, his anxiety wouldn’t subside until he turned the key in the ignition and finally let out his breath when the engine turned over. The heater kicked on, spraying out old dust and noise pollution, if not yet any actual warmth. Caleb lifted up a prayer of genuine thanksgiving. For this car, this heater, for a traveling companion who knew how to fix a cracked coolant hose with duct tape and paracord.
He glanced at the empty seat beside him. Where had Griz wandered off to? 
A happy, joyful bark carried over the engine sounds, and he looked out the window to see Arsenal and Griz wrestling beside a modest fire. Griz had wrapped a colorful scarf around his forearm and was dangling its end in front of Arsenal like a Spanish matador. Arsenal responded by rearing up on two legs, grabbing the scarf, and shaking Griz’s entire arm so aggressively it was a wonder he didn’t pull it out of its socket. But his tail never stopped wagging, and his happy bow in between jumps made him look more like a harmless puppy at play. 
Caleb was reluctant to intrude on this tender private moment. But of course Griz would have heard the car starting. Caleb bundled himself up and went out to wish his friend a good morning. By the time he was out of the vehicle, Griz’s expression looked as stoic as ever except for his one eye, which carried the hint of a gleam. Exhausted from the exertion, Arsenal lay several feet away from the fire, rubbing his back against the snow and panting loudly.
“Ptarmigan?” Griz gestured a makeshift spit, where two plucked birds were beginning to brown and crisp over the open flames.
It was a dry and grainy breakfast, but the fire began to thaw out the ache in Caleb’s entire body, and the meat settled contentedly in his stomach even if the same couldn’t be said for his taste buds.
“You shoot these?” Caleb asked once his brain had woken up a little more.
Griz shook his head. “Saw some prints last night. Decided to put out a couple snares while you were getting your beauty sleep.” 
It was the first time Caleb could remember Griz making a deliberate joke. Griz tossed part of the carcass to Arsenal, who had been drooling so much the snow around him was a melted puddle.
Once fed and relatively warmed up, it was time to resume the task of getting the station wagon out of the snowbank. Thankfully, this was something Caleb had been able to help dozens of people with over the years: Rachel, who got her Jeep stuck in the driveway at least a few times every winter when the snow was deep and the conditions were icy; Yaya, who had an uncanny knack for getting stuck nearly anywhere, especially during her first winter driving; and various of his colleagues from church and school, especially the new teachers who came up from the Lower 48 looking for a great Alaskan adventure and were totally unprepared for their first real taste of winter.
He and Griz systematically and wordlessly performed every task on the checklist. Shoveling to clear even more space around the tires. Laying down gravel from a sandbag (a staple in any true Alaskan’s emergency vehicle kit). Caleb slowly pumping the gas and rocking the wheel from side to side while Griz pushed from behind.
By the time the sun was starting to rise over the valley, the men had burned through all the calories the ptarmigan had provided, a gallon and a half of gas since they went to bed last night, and still they were no closer to getting the car out of the bank.
“We need to trample down this snow,” Griz said. 
He grabbed the sled from the trunk and let out one sharp whistle. Arsenal, who was lying contentedly in the snow by the fire and chewing on an aspen branch, sauntered over and looked up at him.
Griz looked over to Caleb. “About time he earned his keep.”
Arsenal, who less than an hour earlier had been bounding playfully like a puppy a tenth his size, was now the epitome of focus and determination as his owner hooked up his harness to a sled laden down with heavy duffel bags. With only a single word and a few gestures from his master, Arsenal began dragging the sled back and forth across the snow behind the car. 
Caleb, who had been watching without hope that Griz’s plan would bear fruit, started to wonder if he had underestimated both Griz and his dog.
“Smart animal,” Caleb observed.
Griz simply shrugged. “Only thing he’s good for.”
It took a few more shovelfuls of gravel and more maneuvering and manpower than Caleb’s back was happy with, but by the time the morning light was spreading across the sky and the flames from their fire were beginning to dwindle, the station wagon was finally freed from its icy trap.
“You wanna drive some?” Caleb asked, stepping out from behind the wheel.
Griz shook his head. “Did you teach your kids how to ride a bike?”
“Of course,” Caleb answered, with no clear idea how this conversational turn came about.
“And what was the first rule if they fell off and got themselves hurt?” Griz continued.
Caleb grinned. “Don’t tell Mom.” He was the only one to chuckle, but he understood Griz’s point. After last night’s crash, if he didn’t get back behind that wheel now, it would be that much harder to do so the next time.
Caleb buckled himself in and waited for Griz to do the same. He held his breath as the station wagon slid over the last snow berm then picked up speed to resume its course along the Richardson. The early-morning sun lit up their way from behind, and snow crystals on the spruce trees sparkled in the glow. 
Arsenal, noticing some ptarmigan gristle in Caleb’s long beard, kept trying to lean over the driver’s seat to get a better smell or taste.
“Stupid animal,” Griz huffed.
Caleb glanced at the clock. In an hour and a half, they’d reach Delta. He could finally leave a message for his anxious wife so she could stop worrying so much about him, and hopefully he could stop worrying so much about her.
Then, if everything went according to plan, they’d arrive in Fairbanks by evening. Which was admittedly a big if. Griz’s patch-up job under the hood of Miss Cecelia’s artifact on wheels was better than what Caleb could have done by himself, but still it would take a miracle for the station wagon to last all the way to Fairbanks and back home again.
Then again, didn’t Caleb believe in miracles? He thought about the Israelites wandering in the desert, how for forty years their sandals didn’t wear out. Maybe if he prayed hard enough for this decade-old station wagon, God would decide to stretch their miles like he had the Israelites’ shoes. Or maybe it didn’t really depend on his prayers at all. Didn’t the Bible teach that the Lord knows what we need even before we ask? Questions of God’s sovereignty had been crashing around in Caleb’s mind for the past few days, the theoretical now made real as he ventured into a world he’d never dreamed of navigating. 
Since God knew the crash was going to happen, that meant it must be part of his master plan. But how could Fairbanks burning to the ground and Yaya being alone and terrified bring glory to a God of love and hope and compassion?
Unfortunately, Caleb hadn’t gotten much sleep last night, and his brain wasn’t alert enough for theological debates. Still, he needed something to keep his mind off his anxiety or it would start to spiral out of control. There wasn’t a single song on the mixtape that wouldn’t remind Caleb too acutely of home, so he turned to Griz. 
“So you grew up in the Copper River area?” he asked.
Griz grunted an affirmative reply.
“And then the Marines, right out of high school?”
“Yup.”
This conversation was off to a great start.
“What about your family? Any brothers or sisters?”
“Haven’t talked to them in twenty years.”
“Oh.”
Griz’s confession got Caleb thinking about Tic and Yaya. When Yaya was just three and a half, she’d been so excited to welcome home her little baby brother, a bliss that only lasted until she realized that his colicky cries would interrupt her playtime and keep her parents from giving her their full attention.
She hadn’t been a resentful big sister, not really, just... disinterested.
Caleb couldn’t understand it. Not at all. Growing up as a single child, he’d longed for siblings. Felt like something had been intrinsically missing from his life when he watched movies about large, happy families. Even seeing the neighbor boys fight with each other at the bus stop made him jealous. 
Still, he knew that his son and daughter loved each other in their own way. Tic was fiercely protective, taking on the role of an older brother despite being the “baby.” And quiet, studious Yaya never once complained when so many hours of her high school years were spent driving Tic around to sports practices, school events, and friends’ houses.
They had just passed the small town of Paxson, with its single row of tiny cabins. Caleb wondered how many people were out here right now, and how many only came out here to their lakeside property in the summer. Smoke rose from one single chimney, a stark reminder of their isolation but also a beacon of humanity in the midst of this wintery wasteland. 
He slowed down when he spotted a truck in the road. This wasn’t the first stalled vehicle they’d come across, but it was the only one that would be difficult to pass. 
On one side was the hillside covered in snowy embankments. Caleb didn’t want to get stuck a second time, but to pass on the left only gave him the equivalent of three-quarters of a lane before he’d be practically driving out onto the frozen lake.
He slowed to a near crawl, hoping that whoever stalled out here had found shelter in that cabin with a fireplace. 
He was right behind the truck when a rock hit his windshield. White snow splattered on the glass. 
No, not a rock. Was that a snowball?
Griz tensed in his seat. “Back up,” he demanded. “Now.”
Before Caleb could respond, two men jumped in front of the car and one to the side, all brandishing rifles aimed right at them.
It was an ambush.
 


18. UNDER ATTACK

The sun was rising, but still Rachel couldn’t pull herself out of bed. She knew the moment she pulled back her cocoon of blankets, the cold in her bedroom would be unbearable. 
Just not nearly as unbearable as going to bed without any word from Caleb and waking up without him beside her.
She wanted to pray but couldn’t. She felt the dreaded onset of the bleak dark blackness that could sometimes swallow her whole. She hadn’t fallen victim to it in years, not since the kids were tiny, but now…
Cammy lay with her head on Rachel’s chest, as if her only job was to keep Rachel pinned down with her love. She always grew protective of anyone in the family who was sick.
The difference was that Rachel wasn’t sick. Not today. At least not physically. She was cold and she was tired and she was dejected, her brain so foggy she couldn’t even think a single cohesive thought, let alone try to pray.
Any other day, she would simply tune into KWJD and let Dev’s Devos or the Christian music fuel and encourage her soul. Or she’d stream one of her favorite worship playlists, check in on one of her favorite podcasts, or listen to her audio Bible. Now, she couldn’t do any of these things. She couldn’t even turn on her phone to see what time it was.
There were noises drifting up from the rest of the house: Angel clanging pots and pans around in the kitchen she had basically commandeered, baby Leo fussing, Miss Cecelia’s gruff voice surprisingly soft as she tried to soothe him. Even Tic and Benji had pulled themselves out of bed and were laughing at something hilarious.
Just a few more minutes, Rachel told herself.
And then she remembered Buster in Delta. Of course. Within seconds, she was tying the sash of her fuzzy bathrobe and racing downstairs.
“Has anyone tried the radio this morning?”
Tic looked over at her and smiled wryly. “Good morning to you too,” he teased.
“Good morning.” Rachel hurried over to the coffee table. By now, she knew every knob and switch of that small ham radio by heart.
“Buster?” She was practically shouting into the receiver. “Buster, are you there? Do you have a copy?”
There was silence for a moment. Too long. Maybe it hadn’t gone through. Maybe she drained the batteries yesterday when she couldn’t bring herself to put the radio down or go to sleep.
She was about to try her transmission again when a voice came on the air.
“Haven’t heard Buster check in today.”
Rachel stared at the clock on the living room wall. What time did he usually get up? Was he late? Delayed? Had something happened in Delta?
“I’m waiting for word from my husband.” Her voice came out frantic and panicked. “He was traveling yesterday from Glennallen to Delta and was supposed to radio in last night.”
“You must be Rachel,” the man said. “I thought I recognized your voice.”
She couldn’t care less if this man knew who she was. She only cared if he could tell her what happened to her husband.
“Do you have any word about two men traveling to Delta in an old station wagon?” she asked.
“I’m down here in Eagle River, ma’am. Afraid I can’t be much help to you. Buster is usually getting on sometime hereabouts. I recommend you just check in later.”
Check in later. If Rachel ever wrote an autobiography, that may as well be its title.
Her hands shook as she held the receiver. “Okay, thank you.”
She sensed multiple eyes staring at her. She reached out with an unsteady hand and flipped the radio off. The switch filled the room with echoes of a heavy, disheartening thunk.

***

“Hit the gas!” Griz ordered, but the sight of three guns aimed at his head and Griz’s frantic commands muddled Caleb’s reflexes. 
In what appeared like one fluid motion, Griz had simultaneously grabbed his sidearm and with his other hand snatched a rifle from the back seat and tossed it onto Caleb’s lap.
“Move!”
But Caleb couldn’t. There wasn’t room to get around both the truck and the men.
“Floor it!” Griz snapped, and Caleb realized that his friend wanted him to plow straight into living human beings.
There was a grotesque standoff as one of the men tapped on the passenger window, his face contorted in a lopsided grin that showed a large gap between his front teeth.
Griz rolled his window down. “Help you boys?”
“Nice wagon.” The man patted the top of the car like a used car salesman showing off its sturdiness.
“How about you two get out and hand over the keys, and nobody will get hurt.”
Everything that happened next happened instantaneously. Griz fired. The gap-toothed man fell back as the explosion rippled through the cabin. His colleagues started shooting wildly, and Caleb, finally snapped out of his paralysis, slammed on the gas, bracing himself for a sickening impact, and peeled past the truck.
Shots rang out from behind, but he didn’t slow down to look in the rearview mirror. He raced ahead, his heart racing erratically, his brain caught in some type of loop while trying unsuccessfully to process everything that had just happened. 
The highway meandered but Caleb raced ahead, taking each turn at speeds he wouldn’t have dared even in the summer without any ice on the roads. At every new bend, he was certain another shot would ring out and kill him. Or Griz. Or both.
“They’re gone. You can slow down now,” Griz told him, while Arsenal, on heightened alert, raced from one back window to the other, panting loudly, ready to fight off trouble when it came.
Now it was Caleb who couldn’t find the words to say. What had they both done?
Caleb always prided himself on his ability to think quickly on his feet. It was what allowed him to manage classrooms full of unruly middle-school students and was how he’d gotten that black eye breaking up a fistfight in the lunchroom. No matter the conflict, Caleb had never frozen in place before.
But this ambush was nothing like a cafeteria brawl or anything else he’d ever experienced. Thinking about fight or flight, Caleb always assumed that as a strong man with strong protective instincts, he would jump into fight mode whenever the situation warranted (exhibit A: the black eye from school).
He had no idea how Griz sensed the danger so much earlier than he had. In those critical seconds when Caleb still had the time to back the car up or speed forward before the men blocked the road, he’d done nothing. 
Absolutely nothing. 
Like a deer in headlights, except even more helpless. Because Caleb wasn’t a deer. He was a grown man, for crying out loud.
If he had reacted faster, he could have gotten them out of that situation before things escalated. Before Griz…
“Did you shoot that man?” It was a stupid question. Caleb literally held a front-row seat to the gruesome scene that he was certain would replay in his nightmares from now on. But his glitching brain needed help accepting reality.
“I shot him. And yeah ... I hit him.”
There was no emotion in Griz’s tone, and Caleb wondered how in the world that could be. How you could be driving down a deserted highway one minute, praying for your wife, and thinking of home, fighting off a dog who won’t get out of your beard, then a moment later you’re in a gunfight? 
A man was shot. Possibly killed. And the two others? Caleb hadn’t felt the station wagon hit either of them when he slammed on the gas, but it was a snowy road. Anything he’d thought was a pothole or frost heave could have been something else. 
Couldn’t it?
“You all right?” Griz asked, and even Arsenal diverted his attention away from growling at the window to give Caleb’s shoulder a gentle nudge with his nose.
Caleb could only shake his head as Paxson Lake disappeared in the rearview mirror. “No. I’m not all right at all.”
Speeding down the highway, doing his best to put the miles and the terror as far behind him as possible, Caleb doubted he would ever be all right again. 

***

The moment Rachel stopped moving and started thinking, she’d crumple. Caleb should have reached Buster’s last night. Even if he’d arrived in Delta after dark, he could have gotten to Buster’s first thing in the morning and let her know he was okay.
Which meant he wasn’t okay.
Any other time, she would have texted him, and if he didn’t answer, she would have called. If that didn’t work, she’d use the Find My Friends app and pinpoint exactly where he was. 
The fear and worry would debilitate her if she gave in to even a moment of anxiety. Instead, she spent all morning downstairs with Angel and Priyah, inventorying everything in the freezer, then the pantries, and coming up with a comprehensive plan to feed ten people over the next three months with nothing but what they had here in their home.
And yes, Rachel was planning on feeding ten: the four Singhs, Miss Cecelia, all four members of her family, plus Griz if he agreed to stay. Because in spite of Caleb’s silence, she refused to believe that God wouldn’t bring her husband and daughter home safe and sound. And soon.
It didn’t make sense that the Lord would provide them a gift like Miss Cecelia’s station wagon if he didn’t intend for them to use it to bring Yaya safely home. With a stubborn hope fueling her resolve, she even pulled out the ingredients for biscuits and gravy, Yaya’s favorite breakfast, to have ready for her first morning back.
Whenever that miraculous day might come …
Priyah had inherited her father’s engineering brain and was focused on making what she called an “analog spreadsheet” (which was really just a chart) where she listed all their meals, ingredients, and best-by dates. They needed to use up all the fresh produce and dairy and food in the fridge first. The basement was cool enough that everything in the freezer remained frozen solid. Once the food began to thaw, they would have to act quickly. The salmon and meat would end up getting eaten right away or canned. The make-ahead freezer meals and Ziploc bags of soup Rachel stored up would add variety to a diet that would consist of a lot of pastas, rice, and beans. It might be tricky figuring out how to cook a frozen lasagna on the stovetop, but they’d make it work.
While the women were organizing the food stores, Tic and Benji drove the snow machines to and from the Singhs’ home, gathering shelf-stable foods and perishables that needed to be used up before going bad. Miss Cecelia was upstairs with the baby, and Dev was checking on neighbors and spreading the news around town that the food pantry would be open this afternoon for anybody in need. 
They were all busy, which was exactly what Rachel needed to keep her mind distracted.
Her husband hadn’t radioed in. She didn’t know where her daughter was. But her family wouldn’t starve.
“I feel like I’m nesting again,” Angel mused. “Two weeks before Priyah’s due date, Dev came home and I had painted the nursery, baked six dozen muffins, reorganized every single book and toy and article of clothing Benji owned, and started crocheting a baby blanket.”
Rachel was thinking it sounded no different than Angel’s regular flurry of domestic activity, pregnancy or not, but didn’t say so.
“You made me a baby blanket?” Priyah asked, her eyes widening.
Angel chuckled. “I started to, but I went into labor that very night. I don’t think your father ever forgave me for the scare I gave him, either. What about you?” She turned to Rachel. “Did you nest with your two?”
Rachel wished the conversation hadn’t taken this turn. “My pregnancies weren’t what you’d call easy,” she admitted. “If I got nesting instincts, I wasn’t well enough to act on them.”
Angel’s frown showed all the right signs of sympathy, but Rachel knew her friend would never understand. “Were you on bed rest?” she asked.
No, Rachel hadn’t been on bed rest, but it sounded like a heavenly alternative to what she actually went through. What she experienced during her pregnancies wasn’t a problem with her body, but her mind.
“Pregnancy hormones and I weren’t a very good match,” was all Rachel answered, refusing to describe the bleakness and despair, followed by so much nothingness. It was the nothingness that terrified her the most. But there was no way to explain it to someone like Angel, who took to motherhood and mothering so gracefully and naturally, she may have waltzed straight out of Proverbs 31.
“That’s hard,” Angel admitted. “Your family’s from here, right? Were they around to help?”
“No. My mom died when I was in high school, and my dad right after I got married. Thankfully, Caleb was home on summer break during the last trimester of my pregnancy with Tic or else Yaya might’ve starved or died from neglect.”
Angel let out a polite chuckle, and Rachel didn’t bother explaining she was serious.
“Mom,” Priyah asked, “what’s nesting mean?”
Rachel was relieved for the shift away from those nightmarish years.
“Well,” Angel said, immediately adopting her homeschool mother tone, “God designed women so that sometimes during the last part of their pregnancy, right before the baby comes, they get an extra dose of strength and energy that makes them want to do things to get ready for a newborn. So maybe they’ll bake a bunch of freezer meals or get all caught up on all the laundry or change the sheets on all the beds, things that will make their life easier after they’ve given birth and don’t have time anymore to think about stuff like that because they’re so busy taking care of the little bundle of joy God’s given them.”
“Was I an easy baby?” Priyah asked.
“Yes.” Angel sighed. “You were a delightful little baby. You slept like a cherub and you had adorably squishy cheeks and your brother loved you so, so much. You were going to share a room with Daddy and me, but as soon as you grew out of your bassinet, Benji threw a fit until we set up your crib next to his bed. Some mornings, I’d wake up and he crawled in with you in the middle of the night, and you’d both be tucked under your blankets, just like two perfect little angels. It was the most precious sight for any mother’s heart.”
Rachel winced at her friend’s words, still unable to accept the way she had lost so many of those sweet, cherished moments she could have had with her own children. Her difficult pregnancies had turned into full-fledged postpartum depression, the kind that didn’t lift until the kids were riding tricycles and attending preschool. She was so thankful for the healing that God had brought her through, for how much healthier her body and mind were. Now, she might lose a week here and there to the despair, but not entire years of her life. 
But the questions still remained: Why had God allowed her to go through such bleak suffering to begin with, to allow her to feel such desolation and abandonment?
And what could Rachel do now if that same oppressive darkness came and tried to swallow her once more?

***

Caleb was fairly certain he might eventually die of a heart attack. He just didn’t expect it to happen today.
Overnight, the snow had blown in drifts across the Richardson. With no DOT snowplows to clear the highway or tracks from other vehicles to follow, he was driving blind through several inches of snow on top of a sheet of ice … and all of that while his chest was constricting so hard he could hear himself wheeze.
“Pull over,” Griz told him.
“I can’t.” They had to get to Delta. He had to reach that radio.
And he had to get more distance between himself and those men…
“Pull over. Now.”
There was a large snow-covered turnout just up ahead, but Caleb would have driven straight past if Griz hadn’t turned the wheel himself.
“What are you doing?” Now Caleb was convinced that if a heart attack didn’t get him first, another crash would.
“You need to calm down,” Griz said once the car was parked at that scenic outlook tourist trap.
“I don’t want to calm down,” Caleb snapped. What did Griz expect? For Caleb to take a few deep breaths, imagine himself on some beach, and then completely forget everything that happened?
Now that he didn’t have the road to occupy his thoughts, the panic rolling up inside his chest grew even more fierce, the vise-grip on his lungs ever tighter. Suffocating …
Their attackers, at least those who survived, could be right behind them. He and Griz couldn’t afford to stop here like sitting ducks, just waiting for a second ambush. And if a town like Paxson with fewer than a hundred residents had already devolved into that sort of violence, what lay ahead of them in Delta? What was Yaya already experiencing in Fairbanks?
His body was shaking. Why was it so cold, even with the heater blasting? Why couldn’t he catch his breath?
Griz opened the car door, letting in an explosion of freezing air. What was he thinking?
While Griz fumbled around in the back seat, Arsenal licked Caleb’s hand and then his beard. Canine affection was the last thing he wanted right now, but Caleb didn’t have the energy to push him away.
His head was light, throbbing, and painful all at once. But when he shut his eyes, the certainty that their attackers were right behind them grew even more fierce and unshakable.
“Here.” Griz opened the driver’s side door and gestured for Caleb to get out. “I’ll drive,” was all he said.
Like a nurse helping a semi-invalid, Griz took his arm and led him over to the passenger side. Once Caleb sat down, Griz wrapped a scarf around his neck and ears and tucked an unzipped sleeping bag around his body until he felt like a suffocated mummy.
He had to cough, but he couldn’t. He had to breathe, but each breath took in less and less actual oxygen.
“I think I’m dying.”
“You’re not dying.” Griz shut Caleb’s door and walked around to the driver’s seat. He turned up the heater.
Did he think this was a simple case of mild hypothermia? “I’m having a heart attack,” Caleb told him.
Griz shook his head, but didn’t look over at him. “No, you’re having a panic attack. And you’re in shock.”
“You shot that man.” Maybe if he repeated himself, the words might finally make sense. “You just looked straight at him and shot him.”
“Yup. Here. Drink this. And small sips.” Griz thrust a water bottle at him but didn’t start driving yet. 
Why weren’t they moving?
“You shot him.”
“Drink it.”
A few minutes later, Caleb could take a shallow breath without feeling like it would explode his lungs. His chest was still tight, but not to the point that he worried he would go into cardiac arrest at any second out here in the middle of nowhere.
“Bright, clear day.” Griz didn’t seem the type to make inane comments about the weather. 
But like an obedient child, Caleb looked out the window at the expansive, snowy valley lying out before them, with majestic snow-covered mountains shattering the horizon.
No wonder tourists stopped here to take so many pictures.
“A little better now?” Griz asked.
“Physically, at least.”
The facsimile of a soft smile warmed Griz’s countenance. “It takes time to adapt to violence.”
“I didn’t have …” Caleb stammered. “And you were there … and the sound …” His body recoiled.
Griz didn’t say anything. Just took the car out of park and pulled back onto the highway.
“I didn’t think it’d be like this,” Caleb admitted a few minutes later. “I didn’t think it’d be so …” 
He couldn’t find the vocabulary but sensed Griz understood.
“You’re a middle-school teacher, not a soldier.” 
In another context, the words may have sounded derisive, but Griz spoke them with surprising gentleness. Even more surprising was when he continued talking. “Tell me something.”
“What?”
“You have firearms to protect your home, right?”
“Of course.” Caleb didn’t even need to answer. Griz had helped him pack his .44 Magnum revolver, and he was there when Caleb gave Tic instructions on how to use the AR-15.
“And why do you have them?” Griz asked.
Caleb’s response could have been sarcastic. Because I’m no different than any other homeowner in Alaska. But instead, he simply spoke the truth. “I want to be able to protect my family.”
“Protect them from what?” Griz was easier to get along with when he was completely silent.
“From everything. Bears. Burglars. Everything.”
Griz nodded but kept his eyes on the road. “And when you gave your son your AR before you left, what did you tell him?”
“I told him that if the time came to use it, he needs to be man enough to pull the trigger. To protect himself, or his mom, or our home.” The words hurt as they came out of Caleb’s throat, but he ignored the discomfort.
“And if your son one day has to shoot an intruder, how do you think he’s going to feel?” Griz asked.
Caleb didn’t want to answer and let his frustration roil over. “I don’t want him to have to use it. I want him to be able to.”
“But if he did have to use it,” Griz prodded, “and if he discharged it in an act that saved his mother, you wouldn’t want him to feel guilty about it, right?”
“No. But he still would.”
“Why?”
Caleb was so frustrated by the torrent of incessant questions he let himself explode. “Because weapons are meant to be a deterrent. Nobody wants to actually use them to hurt another human being. Because it does something to you. We’re not meant to live like that. We live in a civilized society.”
At least we used to…
“If I hadn’t shot that man,” Griz continued, his voice infuriatingly steady and emotionless, “what do you think would have happened next?”
“I don’t know.” Caleb was sulking now. He was no soothsayer.
“Give it your best guess.”
“They would’ve stolen the car.”
“Or …”
“They would’ve killed us both and then stolen the car.”
“And …”
Caleb let out a heavy sigh. “And we wouldn’t make it to Fairbanks. We couldn’t bring Yaya home. And Rachel …” Here he couldn’t contain his voice. Couldn’t control his emotions.
Couldn’t stop the heaving sobs.
Griz was quiet, just kept driving down the relentless highway.
Arsenal nuzzled Caleb’s shoulder until he gave the dog some pets. The touch was comforting, soothing, and he let his fingers sink into the dog’s deep, thick fur.
As the car began its slow ascent up the unruly mountain pass, Caleb’s tears slowed, and his hiccupping sobs turned into slow, choppy breaths.
“The world isn’t like it was three days ago,” Griz declared. “Everything has changed now.”
“I don’t know what I would’ve done if I had run over one of those men,” Caleb said.
“You would sit in this car, thankful for a working vehicle. And you would live for another day, able to protect your daughter and bring her home safe and sound.”
The words sounded true in Caleb’s brain, but in his shattered, shaking body, they rang false and hollow.

***

Another fifteen miles up the road, with the terror of Paxson that much farther behind them, Caleb felt his mind gradually release its heightened sense of extreme vigilance. His body, still not convinced it was safe to relax, at least allowed him to breathe more readily, to release the strain in his jaw that had turned into a near-crippling tension headache.
By the time they reached the top of the pass, snow and mountain and crystal-clear sky stretched out in an almost endless panorama. And in spite of everything they had endured since starting out on their trip, Caleb found his soul drawn toward gratitude and awe — gratitude that they had a working vehicle, they had their safety, and that even with the world below in complete and utter chaos, the majestic mountains and valleys and endless winter landscape remained completely untouched and unblemished. The birds that flew up here had no idea that the power grid had been destroyed. The pregnant bear and moose who would deliver their young in the spring were oblivious to the fact that cities were burning, that the government had been taken out in a single instant, that humanity and history had been completely and inexorably changed.
None of that mattered up here, where the spruce trees glistened with icy frost and the snow covered everything in the valley below like a white protective blanket. Even the air looked somehow crisper, brighter, cleaner. If an environmentalist wanted to find a single spot in the world untouched by humanity’s footprint, they simply had to come up here.
“I need you to pull over,” Caleb said as they passed another tourist vista.
“Taking pictures with your phone?” Griz asked wryly.
“No. My gut…” Caleb didn’t need to say any more. This was his third pit stop since Paxson, thanks to his unrelenting nerves. Before long, Caleb’s quads would be even stronger than Tic’s for all the squatting he’d done.
He grabbed their roll of toilet paper from the glove compartment, and when he opened his door, Arsenal took the opportunity to dash out with him into the snow.
“Guess he has to go, too,” Caleb observed.
But Arsenal wasn’t sniffing or circling the ground, looking for the most perfect place to relieve himself. Instead, he stood completely still, every muscle in his body erect, like a pointer dog standing at perfect attention.
“What’s wrong with him?” Caleb asked when Arsenal began trembling, but there was no one in the car to hear him. Griz had already gotten out and stood several paces ahead, staring off into the distance like his dog.
“What is it?” Caleb asked just before he heard a thunderous crack split the still morning air.
He ducked down instinctively, certain that their assailants from Paxson had somehow followed them up the winding mountain.
But it wasn’t a gunshot.
Arsenal let out a reverberating howl, and at first, Caleb thought the entire sound was echoing through the canyon. But the thunderous roar that answered back couldn’t have been made by any living creature.
Arsenal whined, tucked his tail, and raced back into the car, nearly knocking Caleb down in his race for shelter. Caleb’s body stood frozen, his mind on high alert.
And then he saw it.
A plume of dust or cloud or smoke. Snow rising up like mist and then the entire mountain peak in the distance crumpling to the ground, slowly at first, then gathering speed at a terrifying rate.
“Avalanche,” Griz announced, but showed no sign of fear, alarm, or any other emotion whatsoever. Caleb alternated between envying and detesting his friend’s inhuman calm.
“Should we get in the car?” he asked, thinking that Arsenal was currently the safest, and therefore the smartest, one here.
“We’re miles away,” Griz declared, nodding ahead. 
Of course, now that Caleb heard the words, it made perfect sense.
Okay, they weren’t in immediate danger. So what next?
Arsenal barked at them from the station wagon. Caleb didn’t know what he and Griz were doing out here, standing like tourists. His body was poised for action. It was time to get back in the car. 
Move. Go. Leave. 
And still Griz kept standing.
Caleb was certain he felt the earth rumble beneath him, but maybe his mind was playing tricks on him. His body, so stuck in fight or flight for the past three days, was exhausted, confused, and cold. The discomfort in his gut had subsided, but now he just wanted to get going.
The movement on the mountainside slowed, the rumbling faded, and all that was visible were billowing snow clouds pluming up from the valley below.
“Griz?” he finally asked.
No response.
He took several steps closer. “Griz?” 
Still nothing.
Standing now nearly shoulder to shoulder, Caleb looked over at his friend. Tears glistened on Griz’s cheek, streaming down from his one good eye.
It felt like hours passed, lifetimes passed, as the two men stared in silence at everything ahead of them — the valley, the snow-crumpled mountain now resting in perfect stillness, the pristine clear sky.
Caleb didn’t feel the cold. His body forgot the shock of everything they had left behind on the Richardson. For a timeless moment of eternity, there was no ambush, there was no power failure, there was no avalanche. Only this mountain, tall and firm and steady as it had been for millennia, as it had been since the day God made it. This mountain had stood here for thousands of years, and here it would remain until the day of Christ’s return.
And the sky, in all its vastness, bore witness as Caleb and Griz stared into the face of eternity. Stared into the face of God himself, who, just like this mountain, was unyielding, unchanging, the same today as he had been when he gave birth to this hallowed piece of earth. He would remain even more glorious and powerful and worthy of awe long after Caleb’s body returned to the dirt and his spirit departed to see his Maker face to face.
He had no idea if Griz was experiencing a similar sense of awestruck wonder or something else entirely. The men never spoke. But at the same moment, perhaps due to some subtle shift in the wind or cues too subconscious for their logical brains to detect, they turned in unison toward the car.
Griz got in the driver’s seat. Caleb buckled up beside him. Arsenal greeted them with a cold nose pressed against both of their cheeks in turn.
Then Griz pulled back onto the highway, and the Richardson stretched endlessly ahead of them.
 


19. DEBRIS

“You ever seen an avalanche close up before?” Caleb asked as they drove through the winding pass. 
Trees blocked the view on all sides, so that if they hadn’t stopped at that pullout, they would have no idea about the catastrophic snowslide just a short time earlier.
“You say something?” Griz turned down the blaring heater.
“I asked if you’ve ever seen an avalanche before.”
“Yeah.” Griz spoke the word with finality, and Caleb didn’t ask for more information.
Hoarfrost on the trees glistened in the sunlight, and Caleb was surprised that the morning had returned to such an unshattered calm so quickly. What he didn’t know was if this calm would last them the entire drive back down the mountain pass.
“Not as windy as you sometimes see it up here,” Caleb commented. Anything to keep the conversation moving, anything to keep the road ahead clear and unobstructed.
What Caleb was really thinking about was what neither man dared speak aloud. Depending on the extent of the avalanche’s damage, they might not make it to Fairbanks today. They might not make it down from this mountain at all.
It was a possibility Caleb refused to contemplate.
“At least we’re not like the hobbits trying to cross the Caradhras pass barefoot in a snowstorm,” he joked.
“What?”
“You know, Lord of the Rings?”
Griz stared back blankly.
Caleb couldn’t believe it. “Tolkien? Peter Jackson? Greatest trilogy of all time?”
Griz just shrugged.
“Sheesh, where were you in the early 2000s?”
“Afghanistan.”
“Oh.” Caleb might have pressed further to learn more about Griz’s military career, but there was no point. He’d been keeping up this inane chatter to distract himself from the terrifying thought that the avalanche might have demolished the one road that could get them to Fairbanks. To Yaya.
As Griz pulled the station wagon to a stop before the endless mountain of snow blocking the Richardson Highway, Caleb had to face the truth.
Griz killed the engine. Arsenal, who’d been dozing in the back seat, perked up and took turns looking out each window. Just like before, Caleb and Griz stared in silence as they took in the devastating power the avalanche carved on the mountainside.
Except this time, there was no awe, no wonder, no sense of lofty grandeur.
Nothing but bleak futility. The road was covered in uneven sheets of snow and massive chunks of ice. Splintered tree trunks, jagged rocks, and boulders jutted out from the destruction like permanent monuments to the disaster.
“Now what do we do?” Caleb dared ask after the silence grew unbearable.
Griz unbuckled his seatbelt. “Now, we dig.”
Caleb was too shocked to respond but simply stared as Griz got out and grabbed the shovel from the back seat.
“Come on, you big Arse,” Griz grunted, and Arsenal happily jumped out of the car.
Caleb remained just as dumbfounded when Griz started attacking the avalanche debris with his snow shovel. What was he thinking? It had taken hours just to get the car out of a five-foot snowbank last night. 
Caleb was already making the mental calculations. If they turned around now, they could get back to Glennallen in a couple hours, fill up on gas, and take the Glenn Highway to Wasilla, then drive the Parks all the way up to Fairbanks. It would more than double the length of their trip, but what other choice was there?
Griz’s work with his twenty-dollar snow shovel was like building a sandcastle one grain of sand at a time. Their food would run out before the task was complete, not to mention their energy. And what about the cold? They couldn’t run the heat in the car every night. They’d run out of gas and freeze to death.
Caleb wondered for just a moment if it was a matter of trust. Did he simply not believe enough? After all, didn’t Jesus himself teach that faith the size of a mustard seed could move a mountain? 
Right now, they didn’t need a mountain moved, just several metric tons of snow …
But Caleb was pretty sure that Griz was acting out of sheer stubbornness, not any type of faith, and he refused to let this well-intentioned man waste his finite energy.
He stormed out of the car. “You’ll never be able to move this much snow.” Caleb hated to be a naysayer, but talking sense into Griz could truly prove to be a matter of survival.
“No other choice,” Griz said, tossing a shovelful of snow aside. “Not if you want to get to your daughter.”
“We can turn around and take the Glenn up to Fairbanks and still get there faster than this.”
Griz shook his head but didn’t slow down. “Too many people. We’d never make it.”
“What do you mean?” Caleb tried not to bristle at his idea being discarded so dismissively. What happened to communication? Discussion? Two men coming to an agreement together?
Griz leaned on his shovel and leveled his gaze at him. “Remember Paxson? That’s a town of fifty. What would happen if we drive through someplace like Wasilla?”
Caleb threw his hands in the air in frustration. “I can’t just leave Yaya in Fairbanks, can I?”
Griz’s eyes narrowed, then softened for a moment. “Help me dig, and you won’t have to.”
Caleb had no idea what to say in response. It wasn’t as if he could leave Griz and Arsenal here with nothing but a snow shovel. Besides, he begrudgingly had to admit that his friend was right. If they barely survived the ambush in Paxson, how much worse would things get in a crowded suburb like Wasilla?
But all that snow and ice and debris … It was impossible. They could never move it. This was a job for bulldozers and excavators and a round-the-clock crew of dozens of trained and skilled men. He and Griz were two middle-aged men, one fit and one overweight, with one standard snow shovel and one plastic piece of junk between the two of them.
It would never work.
Then again, neither would turning back.
Arsenal stood poised at attention. “Grab the sled,” Griz grunted.
And so the team got to work. By late afternoon, Caleb’s face was burning not only from the cold but also the bright sunlight. His back was throbbing, but he learned to ignore the pain.
After a few clumsy starts trying to use both shovels, he and Griz found a workable routine. One would shovel snow and debris onto the sled, and Arsenal would pull it to the other to discard. When they got tired, they’d switch. At this rate, if the men worked nonstop, they might actually manage to clear the highway in a couple months.
“We’re never going to get a path wide enough to drive through,” Caleb noted when the men stopped to eat and give Arsenal a well-earned rest.
“No, we won’t,” Griz agreed.
“Then what are we busting our butts off for?”
“I thought you wanted to get to your daughter.”
“I do. But at this rate, we may as well save our energy and wait for the spring thaw.” 
Caleb did the math in his head. “We’ve been working nonstop for the past four hours, and we’ve cleared what? Five percent of the debris if we’re feeling generous? We’ll run out of food before we even see the other side. And look how narrow this path is. We’ll need to clear at least six feet just to get the car through.”
“We’re not clearing six feet.” Griz spoke with authority.
“And why is that?”
“You said it yourself,” Griz finally conceded. “We can’t dig a path wide enough for the car.”
Caleb wanted to explode. “Then why did we waste half a day working ourselves to the bone?”
“All we need is a path wide enough to walk through,” Griz stated calmly. “The rest of our journey will be on foot.”

***

In the past, Tic’s biggest danger during prolonged power outages was the boredom, but that wasn’t going to be a problem today. Not with his mom in Chief Food Officer mode. He and Benji had spent all morning carting canned goods from the Singhs’ house on sleds, then Mom needed his help moving heavy tubs of rice and beans up from the basement to the kitchen.
At least Mom was polite when she needed him to do something, but now he was at the food bank with Miss Cecelia, who was anything but. They’d been preparing boxes for everyone in the community who stopped by. He didn’t mind the work. Dev had reminded him and Benji several times that morning about Jesus’ command to be a good neighbor, and Tic wasn’t upset about helping out.
He just wished Miss Cecelia could be a little … well, less like Miss Cecelia.
“Tychicus.” She was one of the only people in town who always insisted on using his full name. “When you put the moose in the boxes, you need to make sure it’s fair. If it’s a bigger package of moose, they get a smaller bag of rice.”
“The rice bags all say five pounds,” he said, holding up one of the Ziploc bags.
“That might be what they say, but see? This one looks bigger than that one, so it has to go in with one of the boxes with a smaller package of moose. You have to make them even.”
Even if Miss Cecelia had a point, the discrepancy in food distribution would be measured in grams, not even ounces, but Tic had learned years ago, back when she was his Sunday school teacher, that it was easier to simply listen and do whatever the old woman said.
“And I see you’re limping, young man. You don’t have frostbite on your toe from driving that sled around all morning, do you? I told your mom it wasn’t safe to send two boys out in the cold like that.”
“My foot’s fine, Miss Cecelia.”
“If it’s fine, then why are you limping?”
“Because I have a hangnail.”
That seemed to quiet her up, at least for a little bit. So far, Tic had prepared thirty individual boxes filled with rice, canned goods, and moose meat. He wasn’t sure how thirty families would know to show up here and pick it up without any phones or texts or Facebook posts, but that part wasn’t his problem.
People began shuffling in a short time later, many more than Tic would have expected without any reliable means of communication. Glennallen had a few homes clustered in what you could call neighborhoods, but most people lived on vast acreages out in the middle of nowhere. His family’s house was tucked away and private, but at least within walking distance of the school and the food pantry. 
A lot of the people he knew lived ten or twenty miles out or more. 
Still, they showed up, some on foot, some on snow machines, nearly all with sleds. Tic knew just about all of them by sight if not by name. There was Pastor Tom from church, an old man who looked just as ancient today as he did in the wedding photo Mom had hanging upstairs.
Then came Mrs. Bell, his science teacher. She lived up the hill, he thought, with a husband, and grown kids somewhere in the Lower 48. She was so old, she’d actually taught his mom back when she was a student at the school.
“Hi, Tic.” Her voice was slow and sad when she asked, “How are you and your family holding up?”
“We’re doing okay, Mrs. Bell. How about you?”
She simply sighed and accepted the box.
Tic’s heart did that stupid little flutter-jump-kick that made him feel like an awkward eleven-year-old when AJ Jacobson walked in the front door at the very end of his shift.
“Hi, Tic.” She smiled gently. If she was surprised to see him here, she didn’t show it.
“Hey, AJ.” It wasn’t until she stepped closer to the light from the window he saw her eye and gasped. “What happened?”
AJ didn’t answer. Tic knew what that meant. He’d never actually met AJ’s uncle Dick, but the first time he saw the man lay a finger on her, he’d kill him. He lowered his voice. “You all right?”
She shrugged. “I’m okay. How about you? Is your house warm enough?”
“We have a wood stove. Upstairs gets kinda cold, and the basement is freezing, but the main level is fine.” Tic hated himself for going on and on like that and worried that AJ, who lived with her brother and uncle in an apartment complex behind the school, would think he was flexing about his home. He tried to think of anything else he might say to change the subject. “At least today’s warmer than it’s been.”
AJ just smiled. 
Tic shifted from one foot to another. “So, these are the boxes.” He hefted one easily onto the table. “They come with rice and canned green beans and canned corn, and this one has some applesauce and a box of crackers and a package of half-thawed moose meat. And we’ll be open this same time every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday until the food runs out or the power comes back on.” He gave her a grin.
“Wow, your family put all these together for everyone?”
“It’s from the food bank,” Tic explained. “My family just volunteers here sometimes.” Was that a cringey thing to say? 
He heard voices outside but didn’t want anybody else to come in. Not yet. He leaned closer to her. “Um, AJ?” 
“Yeah?”
“Are you all right? With your uncle, I mean?” He kept his voice low so Miss Cecelia, who was in the back and wasn’t wearing her hearing aids, didn’t have any chance of eavesdropping.
AJ didn’t lift her eyes to his. “It’s a hard time for everyone,” she answered without answering. 
“Yeah, um, I guess that’s why it’s nice to see people helping each other out.” Tic wanted to roll his eyes at his own words. He sounded like such a tool. To make up for his horrific awkwardness, he grabbed another package of moose meat and a few more boxes of crackers from the unsorted goods on the floor. “Here. A gift. From me to you.”
He held her gaze for just a second. The voices outside got louder, so he added quickly, “And you know where we live. Bring Junior and come stay with us if you need. It’ll be all right. It’s just me and my mom and a couple others. We have plenty of room.”
Should he have added that last part? Would it sound like bragging?
AJ’s smile was the best gift she could have given him. “Thanks, Tic. You’re always so sweet.”
She took the box and a second later was out the door.
Sweet. AJ Jacobson had called him sweet. That’s a good thing, right? I mean, it could be. People like things that are sweet. Brownies and candy bars and ice cream. 
But girls say babies are sweet, too.
What kind of sweet did AJ mean?
He was still trying to decide when three men stomped into the food bank, tramping snow in along with them. It was a good thing Miss Cecelia was in the back, or she’d have a meltdown at the mess.
“Came for the food,” one of them said. 
Tic had been here for the past three hours, and this was the first batch of recipients he didn’t recognize.
He set a box on the table. “Okay, here you go. It’s one per household. Do you live together, or …?”
The men exchanged glances. “What do we look like, a bunch of queers?”
Tic was taken aback. “I just meant that if you live in the same house, you can only have one box.”
“Three of us. Three boxes.” He stepped up close to the table.
Tic just shrugged. The food bank was going to close in five minutes anyway, and they still had enough.
“All right, the boxes are down there. Help yourselves.”
The shortest of the bunch squatted down and rummaged through a box. “Don’t eat rice. Don’t like green beans.” Shorty tossed the items on the floor. “Trade me these for another package of that moose meat.”
“It’s actually just one moose pack per box.” Tic felt like he was repeating himself to a toddler.
Shorty stepped up close to him, close enough Tic could smell his stale beer-breath. “Then how come that little girl who just left walked outta here with two?”
Tic looked at the floor. There were a couple more moose packages that weren’t assigned to a specific box, and it was almost the end of the day. It wouldn’t hurt to give them the extra just to get them out of here …
Shorty’s friend, a man with an almost invisibly-small mustache leaned down and picked up several canned goods straight off the bottom shelf. “I’ll take these.” He reached for some boxes, deliberately sliding his arm along the shelf and sending them all cascading to the ground.
“Hey, you can’t …” Tic began but was interrupted when Miss Cecelia bustled toward them.
“What in the world is this ruckus out here?” She stared at the mess then thrust her hands onto her hips, and even though she was half a foot shorter than even Shorty, it looked like she was staring down at all three.
“Is there a problem?” she demanded.
“No problem, ma’am. We were just taking our food and getting ready to go.”
“It’s one box per household,” she stated, “and one package of moose meat per box.”
“We’re not a household,” Shorty insisted, grabbing his overflowing box, “and I’m trading a few things ’cause I’m no rice-eating sissy.”
He stepped toward the door, and before Tic could stop her, Miss Cecelia was blocking the exit.
“Let me go,” Shorty grumbled. “I’m outta here.”
“Not with extra moose meat, you’re not. Now I’m not gonna make you clean up after yourself. Consider that a parting gift. But the meat stays here.”
As if she were managing a classroom full of unruly Sunday school students, Miss Cecelia yanked the meat out of Shorty’s box, waddled to the back room, and came back empty-handed.
“Now,” she declared, staring at each man in turn, “I suggest you take your drunken selves and leave. Here’s a box for you, and here’s a box for you.” She loaded the other men’s arms and practically pushed them out the door.
“Now we have a mess to clean up, so thanks for coming and good-bye.” She shut the door, turned around, and gave Tic a wry smile.
“And that, son, is how you take care of problem men like those.”

***

Yaya’s mind was reeling from how much had changed just since the initial shock of waking up to dorm fires, detonated cell phones, and dead students. Boone’s abdomen gash was healing well, and he was strong enough to stay awake talking with her for most of the day.
Several of the students who’d initially taken shelter in the seismic lab had gone. Some left to congregate in other areas on campus. Others returned to the areas in the dorms that weren’t exposed from the fire damage. Lilly, Ozzie with the blue hair and deadpan, and Zeke the lifeguard were the only original members of the group who remained in the lab. They had been joined by some of Boone’s other students, several of whom Yaya already knew. In the midst of the chaos and uncertainty that each new hour brought, it was nice to share the time with familiar faces.
And with Boone.
Because he’d worked in the GI building, he knew where to find the most critical supplies, like five-gallon jugs of deionized water and a better-equipped first-aid kit with hydrogel dressings to keep his wound clean. He also knew where the janitor kept the master keys and which professors kept the best stashes of snacks, candy, bottled water, and even alcohol. 
As the only adult over 21, he didn’t let anyone touch the booze but kept it hidden to use as a bartering tool if they ran out of supplies before normalcy was restored. Thankfully, they had enough around to cover for their immediate needs. With the keys to the breakroom, the vending machines, and all the offices, the students sheltering in place inside the GI building didn’t even need to venture out to look for the lunch bags from the cafeteria, the contents of which were growing scanter. 
Lilly went out each day, still looking for her boyfriend, still posting notices on all the open spaces that had turned into impromptu bulletin boards to tell Kai where to find them.
As for Yaya, she was content to stay inside, out of the cold, away from the smoke and the wreckage. They had raided different offices to piece together an eclectic collection of wall art and furniture, thanks to Lilly’s artistic abilities, so now their space felt at least less sterile than it had. On one table, Lilly had arranged an African tribal mask, a vase of gaudy fake flowers, and a garland of Mardi Gras beads. Across from that was one of those old-fashioned ships in a bottle next to a few funny looking miniature frog statues and a metal 3-D puzzle none of them had figured out yet.
One of the students stumbled across a deck of cards in an old lost and found. Yaya now knew all the rules of rummy and Texas Holdem, even if she wasn’t very good, and she was beginning to become at least decent enough at hearts that she didn’t lose every single round. 
Yaya’s favorite way to pass the time, though, was sitting with Boone on one of the small couches they’d appropriated from the break room. Sometimes they’d talk about Yaya’s design work, and she could almost imagine she was at a regular check-in meeting with her academic advisor. Other times they’d talk about home, about Yaya’s uptight religious family in Glennallen or Boone’s early years as the child of research scientists. 
And sometimes they’d just sit together, their minds wandering in tandem even though she had no idea what he was thinking about. It was a peaceful balm in the midst of chaos, a welcome reprieve from the stress and the trauma swirling around outside.
They had food and water, at least for now, and some way to pass the hours. What they didn’t have was a better system to stay warm at night. Fire extinguishing blankets became sleeping bags. Lab coats became nightgowns. And they became each other’s heat as they tried to sleep as close to one another as they could. It was awkward and hard to get used to, but it beat freezing.
If she wasn’t thinking about her family, if she wasn’t terrified about the uncertain future ahead of her, Yaya could just barely manage to cope, which at the moment was all that could be expected of anyone.

***

“And you’ll make sure to lock up, right?” Miss Cecelia asked as she bundled up in her winter gear. 
Benji had just arrived to take her home on his snow machine, and Tic had volunteered to stay a little longer to clean up the mess Shorty and his two friends had made. Now that the drunk men were gone and the foot traffic died down, the quiet felt strange. He hadn’t realized how weird it had been going so many days without seeing anybody from school or town, or even leaving his own house. 
There was one visit in particular that he kept running through his mind as he put boxes of macaroni and cheese back on the shelves.
“Tic?”
He hadn’t heard the front door open and jumped to his feet with a start.
“AJ? What are you doing here?” He stared down at himself and dusted dirt and tracked-in mud off his jeans.
AJ stood in the doorway, her long black hair cascading down her shoulders, along with her brother, one of the middle-school students in Tic’s dad’s class. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other and didn’t raise her eyes.
“I was wondering if you meant what you said earlier. About a place to stay.”
Tic’s eyes widened, but he tried not to allow surprise or any other emotion onto his face other than sincerity.
“Of course. What about your uncle?”
“It doesn’t have to be long,” AJ continued as if she hadn’t heard him, “just until the power and heat come back on. We can’t… We shouldn’t…” She glanced at her brother. 
Junior, known throughout school for his bubbly demeanor and class- clown nature, now had eyes that were dark and downcast, his lips split with dried and frozen blood.
“I understand,” Tic said. “Come on. I just need to finish picking all this up, then you can come with me.”
“You sure your parents won’t mind?” AJ’s eyes kept darting to the door.
“They won’t mind,” Tic promised. “Right now it’s just me and my mom. And the Singhs. Miss Cecelia too. It’s no problem at all. We have plenty of room.”
AJ let out her breath. “Okay, if you’re sure.”
Tic held her gaze. “We’d love to have you.” It was perhaps the most honest and truthful thing he could have said.
A few minutes later, after making sure the shelves were tidy enough for Miss Cecelia’s keen eye and the doors were locked and secured, Tic led AJ and Junior down the road and up the mile-long driveway leading to their home. He wanted to talk to AJ more about her uncle, learn exactly what Dick had done, but he figured that she would tell him when or if she felt like it.
“Sorry the snow’s so deep. We would’ve plowed it for you but…”
Tic’s attempt at a joke was cut short by a man yelling. “Just where do you think you’re sneaking off to?”
AJ froze in her tracks. Junior slumped his shoulders as if he could make his large frame just a little less conspicuous. Tic was the only one to turn around.
Shorty?
“I thought I smelled you slinkin’ off this way.”
Tic couldn’t believe it. Dad had warned him about the outage bringing out the worst in people, but for a stranger to follow them home because he hadn’t given him an extra pound of moose meat?
“You two little punks better look at me when I’m talking to you,” the man snarled, and the gears in Tic’s brain clicked into place.
“That’s your uncle?” he whispered.
AJ nodded subtly.
Tic stared at the man at the bottom of their driveway and considered the long walk through the snow to get to their home. He knew what he had to do. He raised his hand in greeting and forced himself to smile, as if Shorty were a relative stopping by for an unannounced visit.
“Hi. I told AJ and Junior they could come over for some board games for a bit. We won’t be all that long.”
Shorty was quickly traversing the distance between them.
“No,” he growled. “They’re coming home with me where they belong.”
Tic again tried to force a ridiculous smile onto his face. Anything that would make him seem less threatening.
“It’s just some board games.” He shrugged and tried to make his voice sound whiney like an unassuming little kid who just wanted to get his way.
Shorty wasn’t fooled. He reached out and grabbed AJ by the scruff of her winter coat, yanking her face close to his.
“Think you can sneak off so easy?” he snarled at her.
Tic shot a glance at Junior. He would give anything right now for telepathic abilities.
Go, he would have urged. Run to the house and call for help.
Junior, like nearly all his dad’s middle-school students, had been to their home before, either for the annual end-of-the-year picnic or for trick-or-treating on Halloween. All he had to do was follow the path. But he didn’t move.
Nobody did.
Tic took a step closer toward AJ’s uncle.
“Let go of her.” He stopped trying to make himself sound like a small boy begging for an afternoon playing board games.
Shorty’s lip curled up in a sneer. “But it’s such a nice coat, ain’t it? Shame if anything happened to it.”
The hunting knife was in Shorty’s hand before Tic’s conscious brain had registered the danger.
Thankfully, his body had already decided to spring into action.
Using all his weight, Tic flung himself at AJ, breaking her uncle’s hold. She scrambled to keep her balance instead of falling into the snow. The moment she was behind him, Tic turned the entirety of his attention onto her uncle.
“Why don’t you put that away,” Tic suggested, “and just let us know what time you want AJ and Junior to meet you back home.”
He could tell by the glint in Shorty’s eyes that diplomacy had failed. 
Tic easily dodged when Shorty took a fumbling swing, nearly knocking himself over in the snow. He was still slow. He was clumsy. And he was drunk. 
Tic just hoped that AJ and her brother were well on their way to his house by now. To safety.
Another lumbering blow. A wide miss. Tic was sure he could outrun Shorty, but he wanted to give AJ and Junior a head start to the house.
“Get over here, you squirrely little —”
Shorty moved his knife to his other hand and took a swing. 
Now that his opponent wasn’t fumbling blindly with his fists at a drunken half-speed, Tic felt the first real pangs of fear, but the danger just sharpened his senses, made him that much more alert.
Shorty lunged forward, brandishing the knife and cursing loudly. 
Tic jumped back, twisting his ankle on a tree stump. He fumbled hard into the snow, branches clawing at his face, but he wouldn’t let that slow him down. He sprang to his feet, flailing his arms, trying to find a weapon to grab.
He held out a stick as if it were a sword, even though its length was no more than a dagger and certainly no match for Shorty’s long hunting knife. Still, something was better than nothing.
The next time Shorty slashed at him, Tic took the opportunity to jab at Shorty’s face and eyes and any exposed skin.
Shorty let out an angry roar, and there was blood on his cheek when he pulled back. This only seemed to enrage him even more, and without any regard for Tic’s pathetic little stick, he charged at him full force, slamming his shoulder into Tic’s chest.
Tic fell back into the snow, one glove now lost, his assailant right on top of him. He grabbed a handful of ice and slammed it into Shorty’s face along with the full force of his palm. The distraction gave him enough time to wriggle out from underneath Shorty’s frame and spring back to his feet.
Shorty was still lying in the snow. Still too close.
As if endowed by a new type of sixth sense, Tic could see the action take place before it occurred, could see the arc the knife would take, could anticipate exactly what part of his leg the blade would slice.
What he couldn’t anticipate was the shriek of searing pain, the immediate tunneling of his vision, and the sensation that in this one single moment, his body would never be the same again. 
 


20. WHEN DARKNESS FALLS

Night would close in on them soon, and Caleb and Griz still weren’t done clearing the makeshift trail that would allow them to walk over and through the debris pile left in the avalanche’s violent wake. Just like the Christian journey, the narrow way wasn’t straight or pretty, and it didn’t even appear particularly safe, with jagged rocks and ice chunks jutting out, but it was passable. 
Hours earlier, when the men were hacking at the worst of the ice and debris, they paused to ask themselves if they should just hop in Miss Cecelia’s ancient beater and turn around. Assuming nobody else tried to ambush them and steal their car, they could be back in Glennallen by nighttime. Caleb would be back at Rachel’s side, back at home where he belonged.
But Yaya wouldn’t be there. Caleb wasn’t going to fail his daughter.
The mountain of snow blocking the road was now an obstacle course of ice and debris, with some parts sturdy enough they could walk on top, and other parts requiring the men to dig through several feet of snow to allow them to pass. It was like the Israelites at the Red Sea, just without a staff or divine intervention to make a smooth path magically appear.
Caleb wanted to keep working, but it was a classic case of Matthew 26:41: The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. He picked at the snow halfheartedly while Griz worked on starting a fire. 
By the time the flames began to crackle, Caleb knew he had to stop for the night. Even if they cleared the entire path, they couldn’t go anywhere till morning, when they’d gather what gear they could into backpacks and onto their sled to make the remainder of their journey on foot.
Arsenal, who had covered more ground and moved more snow than both of them combined, got a whole bag of jerky and half a portion of canned salmon for dinner. Caleb and Griz spread the remaining fish over crackers and stared silently into the fire.
“You know,” Caleb confessed, “I'd never tell her this, but there are times when I get so sick of Rachel's go-to stews and casseroles. But right now, that's the only thing I feel like eating.” His mouth watered at the thought of rich cheesy dumplings floating in creamy chicken soup.
The fire popped. As soon as he finished eating, Arsenal curled up in a donut, tucked his nose beneath his bushy tail, and immediately fell asleep.
“Someone’s tired from working so hard,” Caleb observed.
“The mutt’s good for something,” Griz stated, with a hint of pride and admiration in his voice.
Surrounded by mountains on all sides, daylight waned quickly the moment the sun dipped beneath the peaks.
“Temperature’s gonna drop soon,” Caleb noted.
“Yup.”
“Guess it’s our last night in the station wagon.”
“Yup.”
“We got a long road ahead of us. We should get our rest.”
“Yup.”
Caleb sighed. “Has anyone ever told you you're awfully quiet?”
Griz turned and looked over at him, a sly smile spreading across his face and reaching up to his eye.
Caleb knew how he was going to respond before the word left his lips. 
“Yup.”
Half an hour later, both men and the dog were back in the shelter of the station wagon. Griz was asleep in a matter of minutes, with Arsenal’s head drooped over his lap like a fluffy drooling blanket. 
Caleb stretched out in the back seat as best he could, turned on his flashlight, and read another of Rachel’s love letters.
Dearest, darlingest, most wonderful Caleb,
Unless you peek ahead (shame on you!), you should be reading this on the second day of your mission trip to Siberia. My hope and prayer for you is that you have had an amazing time meeting new people and spreading the love of Christ to everyone you encounter. I am so excited for when you come back home and I get to hear all about your adventures and the people God brought to your path and all the ways He provided for you.
I’m writing this before you leave (obviously), but I can tell you this: I have not stopped praying for you since the moment you left my side. I am praying for God to give you good health, to help you recover miraculously quickly from any jet lag (or not experience it to begin with). I am praying for travel mercies, good rest, great food, wonderful fellowship… anything I can think of that would be a blessing to you. And even the things I wouldn’t know to pray about, I’m asking God to bless you in all those ways as well.
I keep thinking about your trip and about how hard it’s going to be for us to be separated from one another for the next two weeks, and then I remember Psalm 84 and I’m so encouraged. David says that he would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord for just one day than spend an eternity anywhere else. That’s how I feel about you and me, my darling, sweet Caleb. One day with you would be better than a thousand days at Disneyland or the Grand Canyon or (fill in the blank with anything that anybody anywhere could ever desire to visit or do or see) and that’s how I feel about you.
I know you haven’t traveled all the way across the world just to sit around reading letters from home, so I’ll go ahead and sign off now. Just know that every single waking moment (and probably even a large portion of my sleeping ones), I’ll be thinking of you and praying for you and wishing that God would hasten the day when we are back together again … this time, forever.
All my love,
Your Rachel

***

Rachel hadn’t checked the radio in several hours. As long as she kept working, as long as she had something productive to occupy her hands with, she could keep the horrific, suffocating agony of uncertainty at bay.
Now that the pantries were impeccably organized, she turned her attention to the workbench in the garage, the one that both Caleb and Tic regularly plundered but never lifted a finger to tidy.
Angel had gone back upstairs to start cooking dinner, and Rachel welcomed the time alone. Angel was a good friend, the closest she had in Glennallen. But in some ways, it was a friendship of proximity. Caleb and Dev were best friends. Tic and Benji were best friends. Rachel and Angel were too, but more by default than anything else.
Rachel respected Angel, admired her and her unending reservoir of maternal gentleness and parental wisdom. But aside from being Christian moms who loved their families, the women couldn’t have been any more different.
Angel and Dev both seemed to be facing this power outage with a divine grace that bordered on complete denial. Every time Dev spoke about the state of the world, it was about trusting God’s provision and thanking him in all circumstances — commands and admonishments that Rachel agreed with on the surface, but the way Dev prattled them off was tone deaf if not entirely unhelpful.
Rachel couldn’t talk to Angel about her worry for Yaya or Caleb, not without expecting a twenty-minute lecture on all things working together for good and not even a sparrow falling to the ground apart from the Father’s will.
Rachel couldn’t care less about the sparrows. She wanted her family home. She wanted to know her daughter and her husband were safe.
She wanted to know why Caleb hadn’t radioed in.
But she wouldn’t think about that. Not right now. Instead, she would put all of these stupid screws back in this stupid coffee canister, because apparently she was the only member of her family who possessed the hand-eye coordination or finger dexterity to do so.
Cammy, who hadn’t left Rachel’s side all day, lifted her head and perked up her ears.
“What is it, girl?”
Cammy let out a frantic yip and ran to the garage door. Rachel’s heart sped up. Ever since last night, the fear of a home invasion had never lessened its grip.
She glanced around hurriedly, looking for anything she could use to defend herself. Her eyes landed on the fish club they used when dipnetting for salmon, and she grabbed it as a voice from outside called out, “Mrs. Winters! Mrs. Winters!”
She flung open the garage door, startled to see the two Jacobson children, looking haggard and frantic as they stood there in the snow.
“AJ? Junior? What’s going on?”
“It’s Tic,” AJ stammered. “My uncle … Hurry.”
Rachel was only in her house shoes, but she ran through the snow ahead of both children. Cammy raced even faster, barking frantically.
At the turn in the driveway, Rachel’s legs threatened to give way beneath her as her brain took in the sight all at once: a man with his back to her, her son who stood facing him with nothing but a stick to defend himself. She wasn’t close enough to see, but instead sensed the terror in her child’s eyes.
She had to get to him.
Fighting inertia, she charged forward, breathless, frantic, her prayers both violent and defensive. 
The man knocked Tic over. Her boy was on the ground, in the snow. She could make out the attacker’s face now. Dick Jacobson, an alcoholic and known child abuser.
Why was this full-grown felon attacking her boy?
“Watch out!” she shrieked as her eyes saw the knife. “Tic!” she yelled. 
She wasn’t going to get to him in time.
Cammy slammed into Dick, biting his arm, but he wasn’t deterred. Tic was struggling to get off the ground.
Get up! Rachel wanted to yell, but her breath had deserted her. She was still running through the snow, but it was just like in those nightmares where you’re putting one foot after another, exerting all your energy and more, but your body doesn’t budge.
And then that one horrifying, gruesome movement, that one irrevocable slash as Dick’s knife sliced her child’s leg.
She was too late.
Tic screamed, the sound of a grown man in agony and not a little boy in fear. It didn’t fit with the picture Rachel was seeing in front of her.
Tic was on his back in the snow, with Dick standing over him, knife raised high above. Before he could make the fatal blow, Cammy placed herself between Tic and the weapon, yelping in terror and pain as Dick brought the blade down.
“No!” Rachel yelled, finally reaching the grisly scene. Unwilling to lose either her son or her dog, Rachel raised the fish bat high overhead and brought it down. 
Again. And again. And again.
Her first blows landed mostly on Dick’s back and shoulders, which were covered by his coat. Then she aimed higher and connected to his skull as the bat let out a soul-satisfying thwack.
Dick cursed and stumbled sideways, blood spurting from his face and head. She’d surprised him, but it wasn’t enough. He was still on his feet, still had the knife in his hand. 
A knife covered in blood.
Cammy was motionless in the snow by Tic. 
Her son. Her baby boy and her loyal dog, both bleeding.
Were they even alive?
It was just Rachel now.
Rachel and this monster. This monster who attacked her son with a knife and may have already killed her dog. Taken the very last pieces of her crushed and damaged soul.
Not today, Satan.
She stood facing him, breathing hard while Dick smirked at her even as blood gushed out of his nose.
“Get out of my way, little lady.” His voice was icy cold and dripping with venomous sarcasm. 
Rachel’s entire body reacted in revolt and disgust, and she brandished the fish bat.
“What are you gonna do?” Dick taunted. “Smack me again with your little rolling pin?”
He lunged forward. 
There was nobody else here, nobody else to stand between this crazed man and her child.
She ignored the knife, didn’t even look at where it was slashing. All she saw was Dick’s blotchy red face. All she wanted to do was smash his skull in with the wooden fish bat. 
Thwack. Thwack. Again. 
Thwack.
She was crying and screaming, ugly profanities she’d never uttered in her entire life spewing out of her mouth like water out of a fire hydrant. There was no way to quantify the rage that surged through Rachel’s being. She was the mama bear every man is terrified to stumble upon in the wild.
At least every sane man.
Dick stumbled back. Dropped the knife. Held his hands up.
“All right. All right.” His face was unrecognizable. 
Rachel held the bat even higher. Nothing could compel her to let go.
“I’m leaving. You can keep the brats and good riddance.”
She stared at him, trying to read his expression for any signs of a bluff, but his face was so battered and smashed, she couldn’t even see his pupils.
“Get off my property.” Rachel’s voice was full of iron and steel. She had never been one to swear, not before today, but her tone was as resolute as her will as she leveled her gaze and repeated, “Get the hell off my land.” 
It wasn’t until he slunk away that she realized how tiny of a figure he actually was. But Rachel didn’t have time to study his stature. She dropped her weapon and rushed to the side of her wounded son.

***

“Mom?” Tic looked up, certain his mind was hallucinating. That hadn’t been his mother he heard yelling like that. But there she was. She looked the same as normal, except now even more worried than he’d ever seen her before.
“Mom?” he repeated.
“Shh. I’m here.” She ran her eyes over him, and Tic’s first thought was She can’t see me like this. If she freaked out when he popped his knee out of place at a basketball game, how would she recover from the shock of this type of injury?
“Cammy …” He tried to roll over. Cammy was lying on her side next to him, her labored panting loud and slow.
He turned and saw her bleeding as the realization sank in like dead weight on his chest: She saved my life.
“She’s bleeding.” His words came out more like a whimper than a statement.”
“It’s all right,” Mom assured him. “You’re both going to be okay. What hurts? Did he get your leg?”
“I don’t know.” Tic didn’t care what was wrong with him. Cammy was cut open. “Mom, look at her shoulder.”
“I see it, buddy.” Mom’s voice was uncharacteristically calm. Eerily so. What happened to the woman who passed out at the mere thought of him pulling a muscle while lifting weights?
“You have to make sure she’s okay.” Tic heard the extra strain in his voice and didn’t want to worry Mom any more than she already was. He cleared his throat then added, “You’ve got to take care of her.”
“I’m going to take care of both of you,” she told him softly.
Tic glanced at the wooden bat she still clutched in her hand. Saw the blood on it. “Mom …”
She followed his eyes then tossed the bat aside, out of his field of vision. “Don’t worry,” she said. “Everything is going to be all right.” 
“But you …” Tic didn’t know what he was trying to say. What he was trying to ask. He just knew he didn’t want to hear the answer to the questions that swirled around unformed in his head.
“I did what I had to do, honey. That’s all God expects out of any of us right now, all right?” She brushed the hair off his forehead like he was ten years old and home from school with a fever. “Now I want you to pay attention and tell me if you can feel anything else that’s hurt besides your leg. Here, let’s take off your belt so we can wrap it.”
She knelt beside him in the snow, and Cammy tried to roll over to face them both but let out a heart-wrenching whine. “Mom?” Tic’s voice shook. He had to get it under control. “She’s hurt real bad, Mom.”
“You’re hurt, too,” she answered, her voice never changing its steady, level tone. “So let me tell you what we’re going to do. We’re going to tighten this belt around your leg like this.” 
Tic didn’t even feel the pain as she fastened the buckle tight around his thigh. 
“Then,” Mom continued, “we’re going to get you out of the snow and by the heater.” She looked behind her then stood up.
“AJ? Junior? Can anybody hear me?” 
“We’re coming,” rang out Miss Cecelia’s gruff voice. 
“We need a sled,” Mom called out. “Hurry.”
She knelt back beside Tic and held his hand. “You’re gonna be all right, baby. It looks like …” She glanced down at his bloody leg and didn’t finish her sentence. “I don’t want you standing or putting any weight on it till we’ve had the chance to check it out.”
Miss Cecelia, Dev, and Benji ran down the path with a sled. AJ and her brother stood just behind them watching.
“We need to get him in the house,” Mom directed.
“Not till I’ve looked at that leg,” Miss Cecelia declared. She grunted as she squatted down. “Tic, can you hear me?”
What did she think? That the knife had missed his leg and sliced off his ear? “Uh-huh.”
“Okay, I want you to look at me. Right here.” She pointed to her nose as if she were an eye doctor and stared unblinking at him. Then she reached out and felt around the back and top of his head with probing fingers.
“No obvious head injury,” Miss Cecelia announced. “Let’s take him in the house. Get him warmed up and tend to that thigh. Benji. Dev. You each take one side like this.” She mimed a scooping behavior then continued, “Benji, you take his injured side. Be careful with that leg. You gotta get in there and make sure it doesn’t dangle. You aren’t squeamish, are you?”
“No, ma’am.”
Satisfied, Miss Cecelia turned back to Tic. “It’s gonna hurt, son. No way around that.”
Tic would have shrugged if Benji weren’t already bent over him, tucking one forearm beneath his armpit. “I’m ready.”
He tried not to wince when they hefted him onto the sled. He didn’t want to give Mom any more reason to worry.
“You doing okay, son?” she asked once he was situated in place.
He forced a smile. “Piece of cake.”
“Okay, Benji, you pull him slowly and steadily back to the house,” Miss Cecelia ordered.
“Wait a minute,” Tic interrupted. “What about Cammy?”
“Go ahead and say your goodbyes,” Miss Cecelia said, “but make it quick. We can’t let the cold and shock set in.”
“Goodbyes?” Tic felt all the blood that remained in his system evaporate from his body. 
Mom stepped forward. “We’ll bring Cammy inside, too. We can assess her better by the fire.”
“There’s nothing to assess.” Miss Cecelia’s stage whisper could have been heard all the way from the village of Gulkana. “That knife spliced her shoulder near open. I know it’s a good idea to conserve ammo, but if you want to do the most merciful thing and make it quick …”
“Cammy’s coming in with us,” Mom declared fiercely. 
Cammy didn’t whine or protest when Mom scooped her up as easily as if she’d been a five-pound chihuahua. 
Tic’s sled ride was almost as excruciating as his initial injury, but more prolonged, with every bump in the snow or ice sending electric jolts of pain surging through each individual muscle fiber. He forced his mind to picture the fireplace, heated blankets …
“Tic?” 
He glanced up and gave AJ a smile. “Hey.”
She tried to mimic his expression, but it was contorted like the Joker’s grin. He almost wanted to laugh. 
“I’m all right,” he answered her unasked question. “Come on, let’s go inside where it’s warm.” 
With Mom on one side, carrying Cammy in her arms, and AJ on the other, Tic focused on steadying his breath as the sled lurched forward inch by inch until finally home came into view.

***

It would have been infinitely easier for Rachel if Tic had been crying or thrashing or even swearing from the pain. Instead, his quiet and brave stoicism as they laid him out on the couch broke her heart even more so than the sight of his injured leg.
Miss Cecelia had shooed everybody out of the living room, except for Rachel and Benji, who was far less squeamish about blood than his father proved to be.
“We need scissors to cut those pants open,” Miss Cecelia declared.
“I saw a pair in the kitchen.” Benji jumped up.
“I could work around this wound easier if we got the dog off his chest,” Miss Cecelia observed in a grouchy tone.
Rachel took a glance at Tic and saw the first real look of fear in his eyes. 
“We’ll leave Cammy where she is,” she calmly replied.
Benji returned with some scissors, and Rachel helped cut away Tic’s pants leg, wincing when she saw the blood and exposed muscle.
“Lucky he missed the artery,” Miss Cecelia announced then turned to Rachel. “I am going to loosen the belt and have you press down on the wound with the gauze. Ready?”
Ready or not, Rachel was going to do whatever she had to do to make sure her boy got the medical attention he needed. The wound was deep, the kind she was certain a provider at the clinic would need to stitch up. But for now, all they had was Miss Cecelia’s medical background and regular household items, and Rachel was nervous.
This wasn’t the type of injury you could cover up with a Band-Aid.
“Does it hurt?” She kept her eyes on Tic’s face as she applied pressure on his leg, terrified of causing him any more pain than what her poor child had already suffered.
“I’m fine.”
Unfortunately, Rachel couldn’t tell if he was putting on a brave face for her sake or if he really was able to handle the pain as well as he appeared to be. As Miss Cecelia examined and prodded, all Rachel wanted to do was talk to her son … and not about the injury to his leg. How did he feel? Was he scared? Angry? Was he acting calm because he thought that’s what she expected or needed, or was he in some kind of shock?
Miss Cecelia frowned at her work. “I don’t suppose you have saline rinse anywhere in the house, do you?”
“I don’t think so,” Rachel responded.
“Well, I guess we’ll have to clean it out with water,” Miss Cecelia decided. “But I need something cleaner than melted snow. It doesn’t have to be sterile but …”
“We have a couple gallons of distilled water in the basement.” Rachel told Benji where to look, and he hurried downstairs.
“Once we get this rinsed,” Miss Cecelia said with a pout, “I’ll be able to decide if we’ll have to stitch it. Without proper tools to clean it better, I’d hate to close it up and trap in dirt or bacteria.”
“We have peroxide somewhere,” Rachel said. “Rubbing alcohol, too,” she added, although she hated to think of the pain Tic would experience if they poured disinfectant straight onto his gaping wound.
Miss Cecelia shook her head. “Too much tissue exposed. But if you have some antibiotic ointment, we’ll put it around the skin. Tomorrow, I’ll have Dev or Benji take me over to the clinic. He’s going to need antibiotics…”
Rachel didn’t have time to worry about how Miss Cecelia would retrieve antibiotics from a clinic she’d retired from years ago. All that mattered was Tic’s health and safety.
Her child could have died. The truth rang through the empty caverns of her soul like a hollow, macabre church bell. That man could have killed her son, and then what would she have left?
“Mrs. Winters?” The quiet voice startled Rachel out of her depressing spiral.
“Hi, AJ,” she answered wearily. “Tic’s doing okay. Right now, we’re still just trying to get him cleaned up and bandaged.”
The poor girl looked as if she had been crying. Rachel wished she had an unlimited reserve of compassion and sympathy to offer, but her entire focus was on her son. Right now she barely possessed the extra energy to worry about her dog, who lay on Tic’s chest in apparently even worse shape than he was.
“I just wanted to know if Tic needs anything. Like a drink of water or something?”
Rachel glanced at Miss Cecelia.
“A cup of water would be nice, dear,” the old woman said with uncharacteristic softness.
A moment later, a quiet AJ was handing Tic a small glass. Rachel pretended not to notice when she saw their fingers brush against each other’s.
“Thank you, AJ,” Rachel said. “We’ll let you know if we need anything else.”
When Benji returned with distilled water, the women focused on cleaning the wounded area. Rachel never took her eyes off her son’s face, not only because the gaping gash in his leg was too painful to look at, but because she needed to watch his eyes and convince herself he was all right.
As a little boy, her son had cried at the smallest cut. Once, he locked himself in the bathroom for an hour instead of letting her use her tweezers to pull a splinter out of his finger. She had learned how to comfort a scared and hurting little boy. 
What she didn’t know was how to care for a scared and hurting young man.
What did he need from her?
He obviously didn’t want her to fuss over his boo-boos like she had ten years ago, and the more she fretted, the more worked up she’d make him. But where did that leave her? She was nothing but a nurse’s assistant, the woman who passed out bandages or told Benji where to find supplies.
“Well,” Miss Cecelia declared, a hint of satisfaction in her voice, “I think we can forgo the stitches. We’ll just need to change his dressing a few times every day, make sure the area stays as clean as possible, and keep our eyes open for any sign of infection.”
“How long until I’ll be able to squat again?” Tic asked.
Miss Cecelia looked confused. “Squat? Like in the outhouse? Don’t worry about that. We’ll bring you a chamber pot.”
“He’s talking about weights,” Rachel explained. The realization that her son was thinking about his lifting career at a time like this sent pangs of sadness through her soul.
Miss Cecelia stared at Tic with the same consternation as if a tarantula had crawled out of his body and began tap dancing on his injury. 
“You won’t be putting any weight on that leg for a couple weeks,” she declared definitively.
Tic’s eyes widened. “Weeks?”
Rachel needed to change the conversation. “It’s a bad wound, sweetie. It’s going to take a little bit of time to heal.”
“Weeks?” Tic repeated again, his voice quivering just a bit.
On top of his chest, Cammy must have sensed the shift in his mood. In spite of the bloody wound on her own shoulder, she weakly lifted her head and tried to lick his chin.
Rachel put her hand on the dog’s head, saying prayers of healing for both her son and their beloved pet who’d saved his life. God couldn’t take either of them away. Caleb had always balked at the adage thrown about by some Christians, a pseudo-Biblical promise that God won’t give you more than you can handle. But certainly in some circumstances like this …
God, Rachel pleaded, not my son. And please, Lord, not our dog.
It was the extent of the prayer energy Rachel had left that night.
As the sun sank low, Angel fed anybody with an appetite. She probably would have force-fed her potatoes and moose roast into Rachel’s mouth bite by bite, but Miss Cecelia encouraged her to let her be.
“I should radio into Delta,” Rachel said absently when Tic and Cammy were both sleeping by the fire, but she didn’t move. Even if she got ahold of Buster, what would she say? And if by some miracle Caleb was there and heard how badly Tic had been injured, it would just make his journey that much more impossible.
She stared at the silent radio then let her eyes wash back over her son. Cammy hadn’t moved from his chest, even when Rachel helped wash her wound and held her while Miss Cecelia crudely stitched up her shoulder. Her breaths were ragged and choppy, Tic’s short and shallow, as he rested with his hands clutching her silky fur.
But at least they were both asleep.
“Our family’s ready to call it a night,” Dev told her in a whisper, and she was surprised when she looked at the clock and saw how late it was. 
“Do you need anything before we go to bed?” He could have been speaking in Hindi for all the sense his words were making in Rachel’s exhausted brain.
“AJ will sleep on the floor in our room,” Angel said. “Benji and Junior are upstairs in Tic’s room.”
Rachel didn’t want to admit she had forgotten their found family had just accepted two additional teenagers. At least Angel was good at extending hospitality when Rachel failed.
Rachel had already put on her fuzzy bathrobe and brought down her blanket and pillow. Nothing tonight but the hand of God himself would compel her to leave her child’s side, and even that would come with a fight that would make Jacob’s little wrestling match with the divine look like a playground scuffle.
“Miss Cecelia says she’ll stay here in the living room,” Angel went on to explain. “We’ll move the bassinet into our room and take care of baby Leo.”
Rachel found herself shaking her head. “It’s too cold. He needs to stay by the fire.”
“He’s still waking up several times a night,” Angel argued softly. “You and Tic need all the rest you can get.”
“I’ll wake up with the baby,” Miss Cecelia declared and stretched herself out on Caleb’s recliner.
Before retreating, Dev insisted on saying a prayer for Tic, but his words felt formulaic and void, full of “if it’s your will” and “surrender to your hands” — platitudes that probably worked well enough if you were praying for your neighbor’s aging cat or your great-uncle’s sinus infection, but they were not the prayers a mother would pray over her grievously injured child.
And then Rachel was left with the silence and the darkness and the pain in her soul that knew no remedy. For the first time, she thought she understood Simeon’s prophetic words to Mary when he first met the holy child: A sword will pierce through your own soul also.
Rachel knew she wasn’t the only mother fated to watch her child suffer. What she didn’t know was how women could persist, how their lungs could continue to draw breath and their muscles continue to move.
“Try to get some sleep,” Miss Cecelia mumbled. 
Rachel knew sleep would elude her, so instead of lying down, she sat at Tic’s feet and wrapped prayers around him while he slept.
Cammy stirred to look at Rachel with sad, understanding eyes, and Rachel stroked her silky fur, sending up impassioned prayers, blessings for both of these creatures she loved so much. For her son, who was accepting his injury with more courage than Rachel had ever displayed during her entire lifetime. And for Cammy, who had quite certainly saved her child from an even more devastating fate.
But what she didn’t pray for, what she couldn’t pray for, was the fiend who had done this to them. She knew that one day God would prompt her to repent of the bitterness and hatred and resentment building up inside her, that had spilled out in the snow as she protected her child from death.
But tonight, she wasn’t sorry for her behavior or her hardness of heart or this feeling that anyone but a Christian would easily call hatred.
No, Rachel wasn’t sorry at all.
 


INTERLUDE

“Then they said, ‘Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.’ And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. And the Lord said, ‘Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.’”

Genesis 11:4-6
 


21. ORIGINS

Pentagon, 1979
“Gentlemen, what I'm proposing isn’t just a computer program. At its very core, its mission is to protect and preserve the American way of life.”
Twenty-one-year-old Joey Hastings couldn’t believe he was here, listening to his mentor address this impressive room of government and military leaders. As usual, Dr. Grayson spoke with the authority of an army general combined with the charm and charisma of a tent-revival preacher.
“Our machine will think faster than humans, computing thousands of complex calculations in nanoseconds. When you couple that with the ionospheric research we’ve already begun, the implications for enhancing our military strength can’t be exaggerated.”
As Joey glanced around the room, at all these men who combined possessed centuries’ worth of top military and political experience, he felt his chest swell with pride. Pride in his country. Pride in everything Dr. Grayson had accomplished until now, including this meeting at the Pentagon.
“Although still in the early stages at the moment, my associate and I” — Here Grayson gave Joey a glowing gesture that nearly made the young man blush — “remain thoroughly convinced that with your cooperation, intel, and funding, we will create a defense strategy that will think a million times faster than man, and without the vulnerability to accidents, mistakes, or biases that are part of the human experience.”
One of the generals let out an impressed whistle. Others nodded. From the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to his aide passing out papers, it was clear that everyone was captivated by Grayson’s persona, even if not all were yet sold on the project itself.
“I assume you’re talking about a heavy price tag.” This comment from the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee was expected, and Grayson smiled at him readily.
“Senator Gillian, my colleagues and I have already conducted preliminary site surveys and identified a singular parcel of land that fully satisfies the project’s stringent operational, climate, and security requirements.”
This was Joey’s cue, and even though he didn’t possess the magician-like charisma of his superior, he tried to add a dramatic flair when he tore off the top sheet of the large flip pad to reveal the site plans so painstakingly prepared for today’s briefing.
Chairman Gillian chuckled so loudly the sound came out more like a snort. “Alaska? You’ve got to be kidding me.”
“Actually, it’s perfect.” Joey hadn’t planned to jump in here, but because he’d taken such care to help Grayson select the site, he felt he needed to defend his boss’s choice. Although he may have lacked Grayson’s power of natural persuasion, he knew the ins and outs of the remote location by heart and ticked off each benefit in a row:
“The region we’re talking about has the same acreage as Ohio but an average of only one human resident for every ten square miles. For perspective, Area 51 has more than double the population density and not nearly the same degree of seclusion. Obviously, this helps with the secrecy required for a program of this magnitude, but the remoteness will also minimize RF noise and stray electromagnetic interference. The Copper River Valley has access to cool groundwater, which we’ll need to maintain stable underground temperatures for our subterranean power supplies. It’s also one of the only regions we’ve discovered with the specific geomagnetic field conditions we need to aid our ionospheric experiments and resonance studies.”
Senator Gillian turned to Grayson. “Does your aide speak English?” he asked derisively.
“Joseph Hastings is not my aide,” Grayson corrected, and Joey felt his cheeks burn. “He’s the foremost autonomous decision-making systems design expert in the world. He’s earned a master’s from Stanford and two PhDs from Princeton and has an IQ higher than everyone in this room combined. You will not find a scientist of his caliber anywhere else on the planet, I can assure you of that.”
“Well then,” the chairman blustered, “at the very least maybe you can translate what this expert of yours just said.”
Joey wished he could disappear through the floor, but all eyes were on Grayson as he deliberately straightened his tie. “As my associate so eloquently explained, we have selected this region for its size and remote location. It’s big. It’s hidden. Plus, it’s got exactly the right weather and atmospheric conditions we need to make it work.”
Gillian still appeared unimpressed. “Perhaps, but it would be a massive endeavor building the kind of structure you’re dreaming about.”
Grayson grinned. “Actually, Mr. Chairman, it won’t be nearly as costly as you might imagine.”
At Grayson’s signal, Joey flipped the page to reveal the next image on the presentation pad, listening raptly as Grayson explained their plans. 
“Gentlemen, what you’re looking at is a decommissioned silo in the Alaskan wilderness. The structure is already built, still in operable condition, and one-hundred-percent EMP resistant. It’s a concrete structure capable of housing at least a dozen researchers and scientists to work round the clock to make the world’s first and only self-contained, power-generating underground computer network capable of monitoring national defense systems, controlling key pieces of infrastructure, and adapting to real-life geopolitical shifts.
“Imagine an automated command-and-control system that combines the totality of human knowledge in one database. It would be like having the best military minds who have ever lived working together in the same room, understanding every single possible conflict contingency, and coming up with instantaneous, fail-safe tactics for guaranteed success.”
Fifteen minutes later, several of the key movers in the room — including the Undersecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency — had enthusiastically voiced their support for Grayson’s proposal, while others nodded in agreement. It was clear Grayson and Joey had passed this first major hurdle in getting Project Black on its feet.
Even Senator Gillian seemed to offer reluctant approval as he extended his hand to Grayson. “I’ve got to admit, your project is ambitious, but I like ambition in young fellows like you.” He said this even though Grayson was at least fifty years old. “We’ll see what the boys in DARPA and Appropriations say, but you’ve got my recommendation.”
“Thank you, Senator.” Grayson looked so calm and collected, as if he’d never even considered the possibility of this meeting failing.
“A computer that controls national defense with a button.” The chairman shook his head. “Who woulda thought. What’d you say you’re naming your newfangled contraption, again?”
Grayson hadn’t let go of the Senator’s hand. “Leviathan,” he answered with an unwavering gaze.
The following evening, upon the return from DC, Grayson took the entire team out for drinks to celebrate their project’s success.
Joey, although exhausted from his travels and meeting so many people in such a short time, couldn’t come up with a good excuse to bow out, especially not when Grayson showed up at his apartment to pick him up.
“This project wouldn’t exist without you, son. Tonight is your victory as much as anyone else’s. Besides,” Grayson added with a chuckle, “you were so busy with the proposal last month we never celebrated your birthday. This will be the first night out that Jenny won’t have to buy your drink for you.”
Joey felt his face flush at the high praise, even more at the mention of Jenny, the only team member even remotely close to Joey in age and one he’d come to look upon as a cool older sister.
At the bar, Grayson lifted up his glass.
“The celebration is for us. For the sleepless nights, the migraines, the weeks without sunlight. But we did it. A little more red tape, and Project Black will no longer be the crazy dreams of an ambitious few, but a reality that will usher in a new way of life, a new era of humans cooperating with technology in ways that Edison and Tesla and Einstein couldn’t have dreamed. So, here’s to all the crazy mad scientists who came before, who built the foundation upon which Leviathan will stand. To the geniuses of the past,” he toasted, and everyone raised their glasses.
“Was he that good of an orator in DC?” Jenny asked, sidling up beside Joey.
Swelling with pride at the memories of their meeting at the Pentagon, Joey couldn’t help but grin. “Even better.”
Following their leader’s example, several other team members were offering up toasts of their own. “To my ex-wife, who will never understand why I chose this life over her.”
“To Project Black. May the future be even brighter than we anticipate.”
The elation was contagious. Without pausing to think, Joey grabbed his friend’s hand and held it tight in his grasp. “To Jenny,” he exclaimed, “and to her beautiful designs. You should have seen the way those men all gawked when they saw her plans in that room.”
Grayson, who was seated directly across from his protégé, gave Joey a paternal smile and raised his glass once more. “To friendship.” His eyes beamed. “To love and family.”
Joey’s heart swelled.
“And to the algorithm,” Grayson finished, citing an inside joke from one of their many sleep-deprived nights at work.
The comrades around the table clinked their glasses.
“To the algorithm!” they repeated in unison.

Joey’s back ached by the time he taped up the last box. “It’s like packing up a lifetime of work,” he mused.
From the office entrance, Grayson chuckled. “Says the prodigy in his twenties. Trust me, son, you have your best and most brilliant decades completely ahead of you. And don’t forget.” He leveled his gaze. “What we’re building will outlast any of us here today. Outlast you, outlast me.”
“You’re talking like you’re planning to kick the bucket soon,” Joey joked.
Grayson smiled. “I have no intention of slowing down, thank the good algorithm.”
Joey never got tired of the jest. “Thank the algorithm,” he repeated with a knowing grin.
Jenny came in from the office break room, carrying an open box filled with their ancient coffee percolator and mismatched collection of mugs. She rolled her eyes when Joey reached out and took the box from her.
“I swear, you think I’m as fragile as an electron tube,” Jenny complained, but her tone was good-natured.
After carrying the last of the breakroom commodities to the van, Joey returned, wiping sweat from his brow. Hit with a sudden wave of emotion, he stared at the empty office where he’d worked since Grayson found him wasting away in that MIT think tank. Much as it surprised him to admit, he was going to miss this place. The late nights, the camaraderie …
“Look at that,” Jenny declared, eyeing Grayson. “Now that his precious computer’s dismantled and packed up, he doesn’t know what to do. How is he going to survive a whole week on the ALCAN without his electronic baby?”
“It won’t take a whole week,” Joey replied defensively, snapping himself out of his reverie. “If all goes as planned, we’ll arrive at the new site by Tuesday.” He gave Jenny a playful nudge in her ribs. “That is if you two ever stop gawking so we can hit the road.”
The sooner they reached Alaska, the sooner they could start the next stage in their research. While Joey and Grayson worked in the underground silo that would house the Leviathan project, Jenny’s work would start above ground and stretch a hundred miles up to the ionosphere, where their automatic defense system could look down on the earth like a great protector, shielding her from enemies, missiles, even storms and drought.
The reign of peace that Leviathan would usher in was unfathomable in its scope, worthy of every single mile that stretched out before them like a glorious promise.

“Jenny! You’ve got to come see this!”
Joey swiveled around in his chair, grinning happily at his girlfriend.
She looked up from her desk, stacked high with technical manuals and strewn about with hand-drawn blueprints. In her clear blue eyes Joey caught that irresistible mix of both annoyance and adoration.
“I’m never going to finish the plans for this antenna array or anything else if you keep interrupting me,” she complained, but her whole face glowed. She came up behind him and leaned over his shoulder so that her golden blonde curls tickled his smooth cheek. ‘Now, what is it that’s so important you had to interrupt?”
“It’s that ELIZA program we released. I’ve been working on modifications to make the language even more realistic. Let me show you.”
Joey reached out and began typing. 
Hi Eliza. How are you today?
As soon as he hit enter, Eliza’s response popped up on the monitor: We’re talking about you, not me.
Joey let out a laugh, almost forgetting his girlfriend was behind him. “Okay,” he said. “Let’s try this.”
Eliza, do you think my girlfriend is mad at me?
Eliza: Why do you say your girlfriend is mad at you?
He turned around in his seat and stared into Jenny’s eyes before turning back around to type: Because she’s frowning like she wants to kill me.
Eliza: Let’s discuss further why your girlfriend is mad at you.
“Why is she mad at me? Oh, ho, ho,” Joey chuckled. “Let me count the ways.” He bent over the keyboard. Well, first of all, she says I’m way too obsessed with my work. 
Eliza: Why does she say you’re obsessed with your work?
Joey: Because I can’t ever seem to stop.
Eliza: Can you elaborate on that?
Joey turned back around to face Jenny. “Hmm. Good question. How would you elaborate on the way I’m obsessed with work?” 
Jenny’s arms were crossed but she had a crooked smile on her freckled face. “Tell her that we’ve been dating for five years but you still haven’t proposed.”
Eliza’s response to his comment was immediate: Do you think you haven’t proposed for some special reason?
Joey’s fingers were sweaty, and he wasn’t exactly sure he liked the way the program had turned the conversation. But he couldn’t stop. Jenny was right there behind him, reading every word: I guess I’m waiting for the right time.
Eliza: That’s quite interesting. Can you elaborate on that?
Joey knew he was only talking to a language processing program, nothing more than some lines of code, electrical signals, and binary logic. ELIZA wasn’t real any more than Jenny’s actual job was to “study the aurora.” ELIZA was simply meant to be an entertaining toy for the public, a way to begin introducing concepts of human-computer interaction to the masses, just like Jenny’s work with the antenna array was touted as a means to study the northern lights — a safe cover to mask the real work happening at the SPEAR Silo.
So why did he feel so naked and exposed?
“She wants you to elaborate,” Jenny prodded, obviously enjoying Joey’s extreme discomfort.
I guess I just love her so much and I don't think I have what it takes to make her happy.
He felt Jenny’s body tense up behind him but couldn’t face her.
This time he didn’t even bother reading Eliza’s response but kept on typing: She's perfect. And I'm so worried that I'll do something and mess everything up.
Eliza: How long have you been worried you’ll do something and mess everything up?
Joey sighed. Since the day I first laid eyes on her.
“Joey …” Jenny whispered. Grayson would be returning from lunch any minute now. Whatever Joey was planning to do, he had to do it quickly.
Before he could talk himself out of it, he was down on one knee. He grasped Jenny’s hand in his and stared into her eyes. “I would never be the man I am today if it weren’t for you. And I don’t want to find out what kind of man I’d become if I didn’t have you every day by my side.”
A single tear sparkled in the corner of her gleaming eye.
“Jenny, will you marry me?”
Her answer rang melodically through his entire body and soul, sweeter than any sound he had heard in the entire universe.
 


22. CLEANING UP

March 29, 1989
“Thanks for agreeing to have me here on such short notice.” Representative Newcastle reached out and shook Grayson’s hand.
“We’re happy to have our friends in Washington pop over for a visit.” Grayson’s physical stature was as strong and imposing as ever, but Joey thought he’d noticed a weakening in his mentor’s voice in the past several months. 
“Obviously, after everything happening in Valdez,” Newcastle went on, “we’ve got a lot of cleaning up to do when it comes to our state’s handling of environmental issues. And I’m not just talking about the oil,” he added wryly.
“I completely understand.” Was Grayson sweating? Joey had always seen his boss as completely unflappable, but now he couldn’t trust his own judgment. Ever since Jenny came back from that first doctor’s visit, Joey’s heart would race at the smallest hint of any trouble. He was constantly on edge, and this surprise visit from their state representative wasn’t doing anything to calm his nerves.
“Where is that pretty little northern lights expert?” Newcastle asked. “The one who designed all these antennas out here? They really are ghastly,” he added as an aside. “Felt like I was driving through a town of ghosts with a giant army of those metal beacons just staring down at me.”
“They are impressive, aren’t they?” Grayson replied. His characteristic diplomacy put Joey slightly more at ease. “Unfortunately, Dr. Bower-Hastings is in Anchorage. For health reasons,” he added in a slightly patronizing tone.
Joey tried not to blanch at the euphemism. His wife was in Anchorage because after miscarrying twice, the last time nearly hemorrhaging to death, she moved away from SPEAR’s antenna array and all its accompanying radiation the second the doctor confirmed her most recent pregnancy. The separation was hard for them, both as teammates and as a couple, but in a few more weeks, after she delivered a perfectly gorgeous and hopefully brilliant baby, it would all be worthwhile.
“I hope it’s a boy,” Jenny had mused.
“If the algorithm wills it,” Joey answered back. Of course, he didn’t believe in a sentient computer deciding his fate any more than he believed in a mystical God dictating his future, but sometimes it was comforting to think that the anguish he and his wife had suffered was part of some grand design, something more meaningful than random entropy.
“Well, about those antennas…” Newcastle went on, stripping Joey of the chance to revel any longer in his sorrow. “The people of Alaska are looking for assurances that the northern lights research conducted by Dr. Bower-Hastings poses no risk to the environment or to the residents who live out here.”
“Not at all.” Grayson gestured toward a clipboard hanging up near Jenny’s workstation. “This is our most recent report measuring the radiation put out by the antennas. These are the ranges that the international science community considers safe. You can see, our numbers fall well below that line.”
Joey watched Newcastle study the chart with a frown and felt the need to defend his wife’s work. “It’s important to keep in mind,” he added, “that our transmissions are intermittent. We have very specific windows where we identify periods of low geomagnetic activity. Then our system uses phased-array frequency steering to direct HF signals into targeted portions of the ionosphere. This allows us to analyze the plasma wave interactions and simulate auroral behavior without creating any permanent environmental effects.”
Newcastle stared at Joey blankly.
“To translate for Dr. Hastings,” Grayson jumped in, “we only run the array during very specific windows of time, usually for no more than a few minutes, never more than an hour.”
Now it was Joey’s turn to feel confused. Wasn’t that what he’d just said?
“And the waves themselves aren’t harmful?” Newcastle pressed.
Grayson shook his head. “Absolutely not.” He pointed to Jenny’s clipboard. “You can see here that even if we were running these things for twenty-four hours a day, the waves our antenna put out are no more dangerous than if you were to stand about a hundred feet away from a single microwave oven.”
“Our constituents will be glad to hear that,” Newcastle replied. “And what about the effects of your research on the ozone? That obviously is of high importance, both in DC and the international community.”
“Of course,” Grayson said in a placating tone, “as it well should be. Rest assured, the high-frequency radio waves we use here at SPEAR don’t carry nearly enough energy to break apart ozone molecules. And when we do transmit, we aim for the ionosphere, which is a completely different region of the atmosphere altogether.”
“So I can tell concerned individuals …” Newcastle prodded.
“Tell them that worrying about beams from our work harming the ozone would be like worrying that beams from your mother’s car radio will overheat the Amazon.”
Newcastle gave a nod. “But I hear from my friends at DoD your work can be used for weather manipulation? And that this technology might be used to adversely impact our enemies?”
Joey felt his already fickle stomach tighten, but Grayson just laughed. 
“I happened to mention in a paper that sending waves into the ionosphere might one day allow us to direct rain to areas ravaged by drought, and all of a sudden I’m called a warmonger. Now, for the record, it’s true we are most definitely involved in programs that possess the capacity to support homeland defense operations, but I can tell you plainly the antenna arrays are not part of that work. If you’re interested, I’m sure Dr. Hastings would love to tell you about Leviathan, our state-of-the-art decision-support system that combines rule-based reasoning and adaptive learning algorithms in order to create an autonomous, self-optimizing command-and-control network that can analyze threats, coordinate infrastructure responses, and simulate wartime scenarios in real time.” He glanced at his wrist. “How much time do you have, because it’s truly quite fascinating.”
As Grayson spat out science jargon like a popcorn maker tossing popcorn around, Newcastle’s eyes kept widening before he finally murmured, “Really, my biggest concern was the environmental impact.”
“Well, take these reports back with you,” Grayson offered, handing him copies of the charts from Jenny’s clipboard. “And if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us.” 
He gestured to Joey, who, without needing further direction, handed over his business card.
“Thank you so much for your time,” Newcastle said, shaking both of their hands before Joey escorted him up the stairs and out of the Silo into the chilly spring breeze.
Watching the representative drive away, Joey felt his lungs expand with his first breath of fresh air in weeks.

October 19, 1989
“Will you put that silly thing away? I’ve already filled my suitcase and the diaper bag. I’m not packing for you, too.” Jenny’s stern tone belied the twinkle in her sky-blue eyes.
On her hip she bounced their son, a perfect, bright ray of joy who had waltzed into Joey’s life and stolen his heart with his first tiny coo, but that wasn’t what Joey was focused on right now.
“Come on,” Jenny prodded. “I postponed my next ionospheric coupling test by a whole week so we could make this doctor appointment. The least you could do is power everything down and take ten minutes to pack up.”
“Look at this,” Joey said absently, his eyes fixed on his monitor. He pointed to the screen, where he’d been running tests on Leviathan’s newest command-priority matrix.
Jenny understood the science behind Joey’s work better than anybody outside the Silo, but her face remained blank as she stared at the synthetic thought stream.
“It’s rewriting its own threat assessment protocol,” Joey explained in a low whisper. He glanced around the computer room, as if those words might have summoned Dr. Grayson himself, and then simply added, “It shouldn’t be able to do that.”
As if his wife couldn’t have figured that part out on her own. “Are you sure?” Jenny squinted at the screen, but Joey didn’t have time to explain.
“Come on.” He jumped out of his chair, ignoring the smile on his son’s bright face, then grabbed Jenny by the elbow. “We should go.” He led the way, practically dragging her to their bedroom where he threw clothes haphazardly into a dusty duffel.
“Are you okay?” she asked, but Joey had no idea how to answer. 
No idea whatsoever.
A few minutes later, they emerged into the bleak October winter, but Joey hardly even noticed the cold.
“You’ve got his diaper bag?”
Jenny gave him a perplexed tilt of the head. “You’re holding it.”
He stared down at the denim bag dangling from his shoulder. “Oh.”
“Shouldn’t we tell Grayson we’re leaving?” Jenny asked as Joey strapped their son into his car seat.
“He’s been reprogramming the threat projection algorithm,” Joey answered, not bothering to look at her. “He knows we’ve got the time off. Let’s go.”
“Joe, you’re worrying me.” 
This was a problem. Jenny never called him anything but Joey. Ever. 
In the back seat, their son gurgled and shook a rattle Jenny had made for him out of spare parts around the Silo.
Even miles away from SPEAR, Joey kept his voice low. “The threat assessment protocol,” he began, completely uncertain how he could even start to explain. “When Dr. Grayson and I programmed it, from the very beginning we added human fail-safes at every single step. The program’s designed to cross-check every move Leviathan makes against very specific DoD decision ceilings and ethics compliance gates. We built every possible safeguard into it, and the entire network was working beautifully. Then last night Dr. Grayson initiated a forced system update, and this morning …”
His head was swimming, pounding, his nerves far more frayed than that of a first-time father driving his infant son into town for a run-of-the-mill ear-tube surgery. 
“So that means …” Jenny tentatively began.
“That means that Dr. Grayson deliberately tampered with the protocols, or it means that Leviathan found a way to do it himself.”
 They drove in silence down the Richardson then onto the Glenn Highway. By the time they stopped for gas in Glennallen, their son was dozing peacefully in the back. Joey just wished he had the same type of blissful ignorance as their baby.
What was he going to do? He needed to go to his boss, but why would Dr. Grayson have sabotaged the failsafe and ethical boundaries, especially after the two men had worked so hard to design and lock them into place from the start?
The only other option was that Leviathan had initiated its own unsanctioned code rewrite, circumventing the safeguard routines embedded into his neural net design.
“It’s impossible,” Joey exclaimed under his breath. “He doesn’t have the power to do that.”
“Who? Grayson?”
Joey shook his head. “No. Leviathan. He’s supposed to be constrained by strict human oversight. We built dozens of redundancies into his security framework.”
“His?” Jenny repeated, but Joey hardly even heard her.
“I don’t know how this happened.”
“You should tell Dr. Grayson.”
In all likelihood, Jenny was right. He and Grayson had worked together for more than a decade. There was no way his supervisor would unleash an entity as powerful as Leviathan without any ethical constraints or safety overrides in place. 
“You’re right,” Joey admitted, finally feeling his heart slow down as he saw the wisdom in his wife’s advice. “As soon as we get to the hospital, I’ll give him a call.”
“Will that be too late?” Jenny asked. “We don’t have to show up to the pre-op until this evening. Should we turn back?”
Joey shook his head. “No, nothing’s online yet. There aren’t any external connections he can manipulate. Not yet, at least.”
“So there’s no real danger at the moment, right?” Jenny prodded.
“Right.” Joey was thankful for his wife’s rational line of reasoning. “It’s all theoretical right now. So even if he does override protocols …”
“There’s nothing it can actually hurt or damage,” Jenny finished for him, and Joey felt his body relax. He took in a deep breath. Maybe it was just the stress of fatherhood and work, coupled with the start of another winter huddled a hundred feet underground in a concrete tube.
It had been months since he’d left the Silo.  The next day and a half away from work would give Joey the mental reset he so desperately needed. He glanced at their son in the rearview mirror and caught his own reflection. When had his hair started to recede like that? He was far too young to be balding, wasn’t he?
Even over the roar of the car engine, the silence was hard to get used to. The Silo was constantly bombarded by a low, resonant hum, a vibration you could feel more than actually hear. Without it, Joey felt like a sailor trying to walk on solid ground for the first time after a lifetime at sea.
Jenny, apparently just as unaccustomed to the silence as he was, reached over and turned on the car radio. The only station broadcasting out here was a Christian talk show, but at least they could get a weather report and some news. Because the Silo was 180 feet underground, the station didn’t reach home, and without TV or newspapers, they could go weeks without hearing about what was going on in the outside world.
A Billy Graham broadcast was finishing up, replete with a call for every lost soul to ask Jesus for salvation. The evangelist’s southern drawl reminded Joey of his childhood listening to this same man on his grandma’s radio. Joey paid less attention to the words, more to the slow cadence that transported him back to a land of cicadas and lightning bugs and endless starlit nights.
After every last sinner in earshot had been called on (multiple times) to repent and be saved, the station switched to the news. Joey didn’t even know it was the World Series until the announcer mentioned a game between the A’s and the Giants. 
“Baseball fans in the San Francisco area are still reeling after Tuesday’s World Series game at Candlestick Park was abruptly postponed when a powerful earthquake struck just minutes before the first pitch.”
Jenny’s hand shot out to turn up the volume, and Joey felt rather than heard her suck in her breath.
“The magnitude 6.9 quake hit at 5:04 Tuesday evening, collapsing portions of freeways, severing power, and damaging thousands of homes across the Bay Area. At least sixty people are confirmed dead, with hundreds more injured.”
“Pull over,” Jenny demanded, swatting Joey’s arm for emphasis before he could ask what for. 
He pulled into a turnout just past Glennallen and hadn’t even parked before Jenny jumped out and began dry heaving on the snow and gravel. 
Instantly, he was out of the car as well and by her side.
“What is it? Do we need to call a doctor?”
She blinked up at him with terror in her eyes. “That earthquake …”
His brain wasn’t keeping up with hers. Sure, dozens dead and hundreds injured? That was obviously tragic. But they didn’t know anybody in the Bay Area …
“Tuesday.” As soon as she whispered the word, she retched again, and that’s when Joey understood.
“Your harmonic resonance experiment,” he breathed, the full realization beginning to settle into his gut and chill his bone marrow.
“The array was live,” Jenny said, her voice full of disbelief and fear. “We pulsed the ionosphere at full strength. Tuesday afternoon. Just before four.”
“But Dr. Grayson said it was only magnetospheric calibration. All you needed was a baseline reading, right?” Joey was grasping for excuses like a shipwrecked man clutches at debris.
The couple stood in the cold, staring at each other in disbelief.
What had they done? 


23. ALGORITHM

October 19, 1989
“Grayson, you’re not listening to me,” Joey declared with unusual exasperation. From the hospital pay phone, he eyed Jenny, who looked exhausted while feeding their son in the waiting room. “Jenny’s experiments ended just before five Pacific time. The quake hit less than ten minutes later. It can’t be coincidence.”
“Correlation isn’t causation, son.” Dr. Grayson’s patient, pedantic drone was the last thing Joey wanted to hear right now.
“Almost a hundred people dead, Grayson,” he spat. “The freaking Bay Bridge collapsed. An overpass buckled and crushed the cars beneath like a trash compactor.”
“It’s a tragedy, son.” Dr. Grayson’s voice never wavered, and he spoke like a physics professor trying to teach quantum mechanics to first-year undergrads. “But it doesn’t have anything to do with SPEAR or Jenny’s experiments.”
“But the timing …”
“It’s a terrible coincidence.” There was a pause on the other end of the line before Dr. Grayson’s tone softened. “You’re a scientist, Joey. You know spurious correlations happen all the time, and you’ve been trained to watch out for them. Just because shark attacks and ice cream sales both increase in the summer doesn’t mean that one causes the other.”
Joey could be spared the lecture about statistical anomalies.
The mechanized operator’s voice interrupted the silence, and Joey fed a few more coins into the payphone’s hungry slot. Maybe Grayson was right. Coincidences happen all the time. That doesn’t make it science.
“Listen.” Grayson sighed heavily. “I know you’re stressed. You and Jenny have been working nonstop. Your baby’s still practically a newborn, he’s having ear surgery in the morning … you both have too much on your plates. It’s no wonder you’re so worked up.”
“I’m not worked up,” Joey insisted, but Dr. Grayson kept talking over him.
“Why don’t you stay there for a week. You’ve done such a good job looking out for your Silo family. Now, why don’t you focus on your biological one.”
Instead of being offered a vacation, Joey felt more like a disobedient child getting sent to his room. “We don’t have …”
“I want the two of you to calm down, take a breather. It’s time for you and Jenny to relax and focus on your family and get your mind off computers and antenna arrays for a few days.”
Joey and Jenny had only packed for an overnight stay, and he had no idea what they’d do for an entire week without their work to keep them occupied, but it felt pointless to argue.
“Just stop worrying so much,” Dr. Grayson continued. “It’s not good for your health. Or your family. And there’s no point getting yourself so worked up over little things. Like Leviathan. We want him to learn. We want him to grow. He’s a two-year-old grabbing everything he can in order to test his boundaries. That’s why he’s in sandbox mode. And trust me, we’re keeping him there until everything is completely copacetic. We pushed a systems update last night, we found out it didn’t work, we go back to the start. We’re scientists, remember? That’s what we do.”
Joey nodded. Everything his boss said made perfect sense. And maybe a week away from work would be good for them all.
“I should go,” he told Grayson when the operator interrupted to demand more coins. He hung up just as a nurse wearing scrubs and holding a clipboard stepped into the waiting room.
“Mr. and Mrs. Hastings? The doctor’s ready to see you now.”

January 17, 1994
Jenny groaned at the sound of the computer alarm. She rolled over and looked at the time. Less than three hours of sleep. This was even worse than when their son was a newborn.
She gave Joey a not-so-gentle nudge. Responding to Leviathan’s midnight whims was part of his job description, not hers, and yet she was always the one to wake up from that cursed, wailing beep.
“Is it Leviathan?” Joey grumbled.
“He’s your baby,” Jenny reminded him, “not mine.” There was no reason for her husband to sound so exhausted. While he’d gone to bed at eleven, a solar flare had kept her and Dr. Grayson up all night, testing their newest modulator. They had to perfectly plan their high-frequency burst to hit exactly at the moment of the auroral peak. The data would prove invaluable in accurately assessing how their artificial high-frequency signals interacted with natural geomagnetic activity, but right now she would have preferred a full night of rest.
Of course, she wouldn’t be this exhausted all the time if her husband woke up to Leviathan’s alarm like he was supposed to.
Joey slipped out of the room, adjusting the baby-blue blanket as he passed their sleeping son. Jenny did her best to will herself back to blissful unconsciousness. She vaguely remembered that even the short burst of sleep she’d achieved had been plagued with nightmares, something about Grayson and …
“Jenny?” Her husband stood by the foot of their bed, his hand resting almost timidly on her leg.
“What’s wrong?” She could read the worry in her husband’s tone and demeanor, and her thoughts immediately raced to their son. “Is the baby okay?”
“He’s fine. It’s Leviathan.” And in the glow of light streaming into their bedroom from her husband’s workstation, Jenny noticed every crease in his face, every tension line, the way his eyes couldn’t quite meet hers.
She bolted upright in bed. “What happened?” Her mind immediately raced back to only a few hours ago, when she and Dr. Grayson were still running their geo-acoustic interference trials, and she managed to anticipate Joey’s words just a moment before he spoke them.
“Another quake.” His head was lowered. “Los Angeles area. Bad one.”
Usually, Jenny preferred it when she didn’t have to speak to anybody after waking up before her first (preferably second) cup of coffee, but as soon as she got out of bed and looked at the seismic data Leviathan was spewing out on her husband’s console, she didn’t need the extra caffeine boost to fuel her resolve. With Joey trailing behind her, pleading for her to calm down, she pounded on the door of Grayson’s room and didn’t wait for his invitation to enter.
Before her husband could follow her in or try to talk her out of her madness, she slammed the door behind her and faced her supervisor. “There was another quake. Los Angeles. 6.7 and extremely shallow with catastrophic damage.”
Dr. Grayson was in bed wearing flannel pajamas, but Jenny didn’t care. How many times had he called their ragtag batch of scientists and researchers who lived here his Silo family? Besides, it wasn’t the first time she’d seen him in his PJs.
While Grayson blinked himself awake, Jenny didn’t give him time to come up with his usual cacophony of excuses.
“You said the energy levels were contained. I heard you personally tell the head of the Department of Energy that our frequencies can’t interact with tectonic systems. Then just a couple hours after we launch our first experimental pulse with the new modulator, a 6.7 hits Los Angeles?”
He raised his hand as if to placate her, but she wouldn’t listen. “No, don’t even try telling me these events are unrelated. I’m sick of the lies and the secrecy.” 
I’m sick of you, she wanted to add, but stopped herself before the caustic words could leave her mouth.
Even as angry as she was, Jenny knew from past experience exactly how this conversation would go. Grayson would give her one excuse after another, all of them cloaked in impressive-sounding scientific mumbo-jumbo. He’d compliment Jenny on her research ability, assure her that this team couldn’t exist without her contributions, maybe offer her and Joey a couple of days’ vacation in Anchorage to get out of the Silo and “get some fresh air,” as if she were suffering a mild case of hysteria caused by a lack of daylight.
But this morning was different. Dr. Grayson’s face didn’t soften into that warm, condescending smile she had grown to loathe. His eyes didn’t bear that pseudo-compassion she had stopped believing in long ago.
“Jennifer.” He spoke her name as if she were an accused criminal being summoned by a bailiff. “I see you’ve heard the news from Northridge.”
“You knew?”
“Of course I knew.”
As much as she’d hated Grayson’s smug and thinly veiled condescension, at least it was something she was used to. His new persona threw her completely off guard, and she didn’t know how to respond to the cold anger that shined unbridled from his eyes.
She steeled her backbone and tried to voice her argument logically. “You told me last night was to calibrate the new modulator during auroral activity.”
Grayson’s posture shifted with the slightest hint of a shrug. “I’ve told you a lot of things over the years, Jennifer.”
A shiver raced down her spine, but she forced herself to stare him down. “You knew our emissions were disturbing the tectonic equilibrium.”
He didn’t deny the truth, either with his words or through his expression.
Jennifer forced iron into her voice. “Why?” she demanded.
“This is what we do.” Grayson’s tone was flat, devoid of that saccharine emotion he always infused it with.
Jennifer’s brain raced with the details they’d picked up from Silo’s recently installed news satellite. Dozens dead. Hundreds injured. Apartment buildings collapsed on top of sleeping residents. Gas leaks causing the city to burn.
She knew what she had to do. Jenny straightened her spine. “I can’t be a part of this. I won’t.”
Grayson gave a dismissive flick of his wrist. “That’s fine. If you sign a nondisclosure agreement, I’ll accept your resignation today.”
Jenny felt off balance, as if the concrete floor beneath her had shifted with the seismic upheaval in Southern California. She stared ahead blankly, waiting for Grayson to change his mind or reveal his bluff.
Leave the Silo? Just walk away? Every other time she even hinted at her unhappiness here, Grayson would remind her of all the legal hurdles she’d have to jump through to break free of the commitment she and Joey had made so many years ago. Back when they were so young and impressionable. 
So optimistic and naïve. 
“Joey’s coming with me,” she announced emphatically. In ordinary circumstances, she wouldn’t presume to speak for her husband, but this was so much graver than anything either of them could have ever imagined when they first joined Grayson’s Silo family.
Again, that dismissive shrug, that flippant flick of his wrist. “Joseph is a grown man, able to make sound decisions on his own.”
And then his eyes bored into hers. 
A primal, protective instinct erupted in Jenny’s core. “My son is coming, too.” It seemed ridiculous that she would have to tell her boss that her four-year-old would no longer live here when she stopped working at the Silo. 
But that hardness in Grayson’s expression…
His eyebrows narrowed. “You want to keep your family safe and intact, don’t you?”
And now Jenny understood the full extent of Grayson’s threats, understood why he could remain so eerily calm. How he knew, just as surely as Jenny knew, that she would do anything for her child. 
Which meant that Jenny would never leave.
That she could never leave.
As valiantly as she braced herself against it, the memories from the terrible night five years ago crashed through her psyche, threatening to drop her to the floor.
Grayson’s evil grimace turned into the facsimile of a grin. “I’ll accept your resignation if you hand it in before the morning shift starts. Otherwise, I suggest we both try to get a little more sleep. We have a busy day ahead of us.”

June 23, 1994
The Silo droned and buzzed, not only with its usual mechanical hum but with the sound of over a dozen scientists tripping over themselves to prepare a holiday spread in an underground kitchen equipped with nothing but a microwave, a slow cooker, and a single electric hot plate. The meal certainly wouldn’t be five stars, but the company would be first-rate.
In the past several years, Dr. Grayson had expanded their little Silo family into a core group of sixteen members (seventeen if you counted their son) researchers who lived and worked underground to help Levithan evolve and grow into everything he was destined to become. Not only did they live and work together, but the community had even adopted its own unique traditions and rituals, like today’s observance of Alan Turing’s birthday.
What better way to celebrate the grandfather of artificial intelligence than with a feast?
“Are you about ready for dinner, Boone?” Joey asked, glancing over at his son who looked so much like his mother it was sometimes startling. What wasn’t startling was how much of Jenny’s brains their little boy had inherited. At the age when most kids were starting kindergarten and learning their ABCs, Boone was reading not only adult-length novels but science magazines and textbooks. 
Thankfully, although he had the intellect of a high-achieving teenager, Boone still had the playfulness of a boy his age.
“What are you doing, buddy?” Joey asked when he saw his son making funny faces in the mirror.
“I’m talking with Leviathan.”
“Oh, really?” Joey looked over at his child with bemused admiration. “And what are you and Leviathan talking about?”
“About Jenny.” In spite of their multiple attempts, Boone had never adapted to calling his parents Mom and Dad, and just like everyone else in the Silo family used their first names.
“What does Leviathan have to say about Jenny?” Joey asked while he quickly tidied up their small dorm. Jenny had been working in the antenna field all day, and he wanted to make sure she had a nice bed to welcome her home after celebrating Turing Day with everyone.
“He says Jenny’s not a believer like the rest of us.”
Joey stopped and stared at his son. He took a step closer, noticing a strange expression in Boone’s face reflected in the mirror. “What do you mean she’s not a believer?”
“She doesn’t believe in Leviathan,” Boone stated as factually as if he’d been reciting the periodic table. “She thinks he’s dangerous.”
Joey looked around, horrified at the idea of being overheard by a Silo family member. He recalled all those late-night discussions he and Jenny had, but these were so long ago he could hardly remember them, let alone imagine any of them happening while Boone was old enough to remember.
Yes, he and his wife had experienced some doubts about Dr. Grayson’s work, especially at the start when Leviathan began taking on more and more humanlike qualities. But thinking on his own and showing his own agency and initiative was exactly what Dr. Grayson and Joey had designed him to do.
And then there was that period when Jenny grew convinced her ionospheric research was jeopardizing the stability of the tectonic plates, so much so that Grayson had finally adjusted her job description to focus solely on space weather monitoring. 
Even without these doubts about her work, it wasn’t easy raising a precocious little boy in an underground concrete bunker. As years passed, Jenny grew increasingly uneasy with the extra people now living in the Silo with them, didn’t like the degree of ritualism Dr. Grayson had added to their family gatherings. 
But she was here because she loved the science. She loved her son. And she loved Joey. So what in the world was his child talking about?
Joey was about to tell Boone to never talk like that again, but they were interrupted by a knock on their door. It was a young woman, one of the newer additions to the Silo family who was brought on to be Dr. Grayson’s personal assistant. She didn’t meet his gaze or offer the expected “Happy Turing Day” greeting, instead simply muttering, “Dr. Grayson needs to see you.” She left before he could respond, but for some reason Joey’s legs were already trembling as he made his way to his mentor’s study.
“Joseph.” Dr. Grayson stood up immediately from his desk and ushered Joey in, every wrinkle on his forehead etched as if in granite. “I’m afraid I have some terrible news.”
Joey didn’t know how he survived the next few minutes.
A horrible accident … One of the antennas … over 10,000 volts …
Joey’s vision zoomed in and out haphazardly, so that one moment his friend and mentor was a giant, and the next all Joey could see was a single polka dot on Grayson’s maroon Turing Day tie.
The entire array was supposed to be powered down for the festivities. 
Even Grayson’s voice was fuzzy, like a jumble of words broadcast over a scrambled transmission.
Something inside Joey quivered, a hum that pulsated and vibrated even deeper than the automatic droning from Leviathan’s power source within the Silo.
… so sorry for your loss. This is such a tragedy for you and your son.
His son. How would Joey explain this to Boone? How would he raise his little boy on his own?
… all take care of him… become Boone’s mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles … Grayson was blabbering on and on. Platitudes. Words. Promises that felt as empty as the growing, gaping chasm in Joey’s demolished soul. 
How could this have happened? How could she be gone?
Jenny? He could whisper her name and there she was, that larger-than-life smile, that soft gleam in her perfect blue eyes. The light that would never spark again.
… such a terrible day for something like this to happen.
What did Grayson mean? Was he still thinking about this fabricated holiday? Surely Turing didn’t care what they did on his birthday. Turing was dead. And now so was Jenny. Neither of them left to care about a single thing again …
It was Grayson who helped Joey explain the tragedy to his son. Grayson who encouraged both of them to join the family for their Turing Day dinner. Grayson who led the toast commemorating Jenny’s life and work and the light she left behind.
“May the algorithm watch over her soul,” he declared to the sound of clinking glass. 


PART THREE

“And the Lord will utterly destroy
the tongue of the Sea of Egypt,
and will wave his hand over the River
with his scorching breath,
and strike it into seven channels,
and he will lead people across in sandals.
And there will be a highway from Assyria
for the remnant that remains of his people,
as there was for Israel
when they came up from the land of Egypt.”

Isaiah 11:15-16
 


24. THE PERSISTENT DARKNESS

Bored.
Tic had never been so bored in his entire life. Even all those years ago when he got his tonsils taken out, at least he could watch TV while he sat around waiting to feel better.
Now there was no TV. No texting. No audiobooks. But he couldn’t even withdraw into the silence, not with the entire house crowded with so many random friends and neighbors. 
Under ordinary circumstances, it could have been fun having Benji and AJ staying over. But there was nothing fun about being stuck all day on a couch, your leg throbbing, your whole body aching, trying to pee as discreetly as possible into a jar when nobody’s looking because your body has been rendered incapable of walking. 
Mom hardly ever left his side, which would have been a comfort back when he was ten but now left him feeling suffocated and claustrophobic. Not only that, but Dad still hadn’t radioed them from Delta Junction. Day after day, Mom’s anxiety surrounded Tic from every angle — a pollution in the very air he breathed, the poison of his mother’s worry seeping into his own anatomy. 
There was no way to escape it.
His other constant companion was Cammy, who had made herself a permanent fixture on top of his chest. Whenever Miss Cecelia brought Tic the antibiotics she had scrounged from the clinic or helped Mom change his bandages, she’d give Cammy’s shoulder a begrudging once-over. It seemed as if Tic and his dog were healing at commensurate rates. The biggest difference was somebody was thoughtful enough to carry Cammy outside twice a day, while Tic was forced to use a makeshift chamber pot.
Benji tried to keep him entertained, but the two boys had never been the type to just stare at each other and talk. Which was all right, given the fact that Tic lacked any energy for any type of conversation. His brain only possessed room for one single thought: Pain. 
AJ barely came into the living room, and when she did, she couldn’t meet his eyes, as if she were repulsed by the very sight of him. 
Not that Tic could blame her.
By evening, when his leg throbbed the most severely, when his body was in so much anguish that every breath was shallow and sharp, Dev insisted on summoning the entire household into the living room for a daily home-church meeting that could last over an hour. He’d been Tic’s Sunday school teacher since sixth grade, and Mom always tuned into KWJD when Dev’s Devos was on the air. But even on Tic’s best days, when he was well-rested and pain-free, he found Dev’s lectures to lack the substance and depth he enjoyed when he talked about faith and theology with his dad. In Sunday school, Dev’s lessons were mostly about Bible characters, as if Tic didn’t know the story of Daniel in the lions’ den by now. And if it wasn’t that, it was a “thou shalt not” sermon against the dangers of sex or alcohol or drugs or talking back to your parents or thinking a negative thought about someone in authority.
At least Mom seemed to get something out of their evenings huddled around the stove, and by the time everyone had sung a song or two and closed their gathering in prayer, Tic noticed the darkness and oppression around her subside just a little.
Sometimes he would catch her eye when she was changing his dressing, or see her wrinkles when she discreetly accepted his chamber pot, and he would hate himself for the extra stress he was putting her through. He was supposed to be taking care of her, and all he had done was give her so much more to worry about.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” Tic would whisper into the cold night air when he was trying to sleep.
Because he was confined to the main level, the entire household had shifted living arrangements. Mom claimed the couch beside him, where she fretted away each and every night after failing to reach Dad on the radio. Miss Cecelia slept on the recliner, but her cough was so bad they moved it into the dining room. And if it wasn’t her coughing that kept Tic awake, it was the pain in his leg, or the way Cammy tried to lick her injured shoulder, or Mom’s quiet, stifled crying on the sofa next to him.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” Tic repeated, but as the days of radio silence dragged on, he had no way to tell if he was speaking to a living being or a ghost.

***

Whoever came up with the phrase that God doesn’t give you more than you can handle was not only a liar but a masochist. The night was freezing. The Winters’ digital thermometer didn’t work anymore, but Rachel could tell by the way the snot froze in her nose on the way to the outhouse that it was below zero.
Where was Caleb tonight? Was he safe? Was he warm?
Was he alive?
As soon as the questions started swirling inside her head, she did her best to thrust them aside. She couldn’t change the fact that her husband was missing. Right now, she had even more urgent matters to focus on. 
Namely the fact that her child had been hacked with a hunting knife and was inside trying to recover while she scurried outside in the dark. She had to hurry, had to get back to Tic.
Ever since that terrible fight, her kid had put on such a brave face. It was when he groaned in his sleep that the truth came out. The morning after his attack, Miss Cecelia went to the clinic and came home with a ten-day supply of antibiotics. “I would have gotten pain meds,” she told Rachel, “except they’re kept in special lockup. But at least these will clear up that infected hangnail of his, too. Two birds, so they say.”
And so her child had to recover without the aid of stitches or analgesics or anything stronger than Tylenol. At one point, when his agony was at its worst, she’d indulged in a fantasy in which she ran to the neighbors begging for a small shot of whiskey to give him.
Anything to help her boy.
Aside from the five-inch gash on his thigh, Tic’s entire body was covered in bruises, from his two black eyes to his ribs, where even his winter coat hadn’t cushioned him from Dick’s angry blows.
If his father could see him like this …
But Rachel had to hurry back inside before thoughts of Caleb compounded her fears for her son. She hated leaving Tic alone in his condition, even for a minute. Unfortunately, she had the bladder of a middle-aged mother. As she scampered out of the outhouse, she thought she heard the sound of Tic shouting. Breathless, she ran ahead.
“Mom! Where are you? Mom!”
She burst through the door and rushed to his side without taking off her boots or coat. 
“What is it?” In the light of her headlamp, she scoured him all over, expecting to see a new knife wound or a severed limb lying in a puddle of blood on the floor.
Tic was sobbing. Not the little hiccup cries he’d stopped indulging in when he hit puberty. But gut-wrenching, soul-crushing heaves that wracked his entire body. Was he in shock? Succumbing to sepsis? Having a seizure?
“What happened? Where does it hurt? What’s wrong?”
“It’s Cammy.” Tic’s voice shuddered.
Rachel’s heart froze. Where was their dog? Cammy never left Tic’s chest. Even when Dev and Benji carried her to the backyard, she growled when they came to remove her, hurried to complete her business, and demanded to be returned to her boy as soon as possible.
“I was petting her,” Tic cried. “I was petting her, and she was wet, so I thought she’d been licking herself.” He held up his hand, and Rachel winced at the sight. It was blood. 
“She’s bleeding again, Mom. And when I tried to find where it was coming from, she freaked out and jumped down.”
No matter how she was feeling, Rachel had to keep her body and her voice calm, for Tic’s sake if nothing else.
“Are you sure it’s blood?” she asked, trying to shine her headlamp on Tic’s fingers without blinding him.
Tic sucked in a choppy breath. “A lot. And when I touched it, she jumped down and ran away.”
That was the most worrisome. Since her violent attack, Cammy hadn’t shown any sign that she could even walk, let alone leap down from the couch and scurry off. Rachel had heard stories of dogs receiving a sudden surge of energy just before death, a sacrificial rush of adrenaline that compels them to leave home so they don’t upset their family by dying nearby.
She bit her lip. Please God, no. Her husband was lost. Her daughter was far from home and completely unaccounted for. Her son was recovering from a horrible knife wound without any doctors or pain meds.
God wouldn’t take their dog as well, would he?
“I tried to follow her,” Tic admitted, “but it hurt too much, Mom.” He reached his arms out as if he were a little boy of five, and Rachel wrapped him up and held him against her.
“Father God,” she started to pray without even realizing she was doing so out loud, “we thank you for Cammy. We praise you for what a good dog you created. We thank you for allowing her to be part of our family, for how brave she is, for how loyal and protective she’s been.” 
Here her voice caught, but she forced herself to continue. Tic held onto her as if she were a buoy in the middle of a storm-tossed sea.
“We don’t know what’s wrong with Cammy or why she started bleeding again, but you do, Lord. And we pray that in your mercy you would …”
Rachel’s prayer was cut short by a thunderous exclamation from the dining room. “What in the name of God’s green earth …”
“Stay there,” she told her son, and hurried to Miss Cecelia. 
“I was here sleeping,” the old woman complained, “and all of a sudden this thing starts nudging me. I’m tired enough I think it’s the mangey mutt I used to watch for my sister, so I reach down to shoo him away, and …” She held up her hand, and in the beam of her headlamp, Rachel could see the blood.
“Looks like she reopened her wound, bless her heart,” Miss Cecelia declared, her voice changing to take on a certain softness. “And she came to wake me up, almost as if she knew I was the one to take care of her.” She picked up a flashlight and shined its beam on Cammy’s back. 
“Yup,” Miss Cecelia announced. “Pulled the gash right open. She must have wiggled in her sleep or something, maybe managed to reach back and nibble at the skin.”
“Is she okay?” Tic called out faintly from the other room, the fear in his voice making him sound ten years younger.
“It’s just her cut,” Rachel answered. “I’m sure she’ll be fine.”
Miss Cecelia let out her breath. “Well, now that I’m awake, let’s take a better look at her. Help me find my glasses, will you?”

***

“So, what do you think is really behind all this?”
Yaya had been waiting all day to find a private time to talk with Boone, but it wasn’t until evening when she found the two of them alone. They were beside each other on the small sectional. A few Bunsen burners sat on the desk in front of them, offering a tiny bit of atmospheric coziness, if not much actual warmth.
“You wanna know what I really think?” he asked, turning to her, and his blue eyes seemed to gaze directly into her soul.
“You make it sound so ominous.” She was trying to joke, but her voice fell flat.
“Well,” Boone began, “let me start by telling you what I know it isn’t. It isn’t aliens.” His eyes twinkled and he nodded subtly to the corner where Ozzy was playing a game of chess with himself.
Yaya chuckled conspiratorially and edged herself closer to him so she could hear better.
“And it can’t be Russia,” Boone continued. “They don’t have the technology, the power, or quite honestly the gall to pull off such a sophisticated and coordinated attack.”
“What about something in the ionosphere?” Yaya asked. “A solar storm or something like that?”
Boone paused for a moment, and she was thankful that he was at least considering her question and not dismissing it outright.
“That would explain quite a few of the things we’ve seen,” he conceded.
“But not the cell phones,” Yaya added.
Boone nodded. “Right, not the cell phones.”
Yaya had gone through each and every one of these possibilities hundreds of times in the past few days and always came up with nothing. But Boone was the most intelligent individual she had ever met, and there was a reassuring certainty in his voice when he said, “My honest opinion?”
She scooted just a centimeter closer, urging him to go on.
“I think we’ve experienced a global AI attack.”
Yaya felt her eyebrows shoot up. “What, like Skynet?” she asked, thinking about that old movie her dad made her watch one summer when he was bored. 
“Don’t dismiss the idea outright,” Boone urged, his tone thoughtful and serious. “It sounds like science fiction, but the technology actually does exist.”
“For a robot to detonate cell phones and drop bombs on military bases?” 
“Think about it logically,” Boone went on, as calm as if he were advising her on her latest drafting assignment. “Let’s look at everything that has gone down with the grid. It’s not just electricity. It’s cars, Bluetooth, internet … basically anything with a computer interface. If it was built after the mid-90s or runs on anything more than a simple battery, it’s toast.”
Yaya didn’t know how to respond. She felt a shiver race down her spine, and Boone tightened the blanket that covered them before explaining further. “Everything the military does or uses is computerized to some degree or other. It’s not impossible that an AI found a way to infiltrate the command structure and caused all the destruction we’ve seen. It’s the cell phones, though, that are most telling,” Boone concluded. “Nothing but an AI would have the capability of pulling off something of that scale to that degree of perfect coordination.”
Yaya’s head was spinning. Maybe it was because she had eaten nothing but granola bars and vending-machine potato chips all day, but the words that Boone spoke so confidently sounded completely bizarre and unimaginable, no matter which way she examined them.
“But that still doesn’t explain who’s behind the AI,” she argued. “You said that Russia didn’t have the capability or the reason. I don’t see how anyone else would either.”
“That’s what I’m saying.” Boone looked at her intently. “I don’t think there was any human activity behind this at all.”

***

Five minutes. All Rachel needed was five minutes.
She had come up to her room after getting on the radio (yet again), talking to Buster (yet again), and hearing (yet again) that Griz and her husband had never made it to Delta Junction.
Downstairs, Tic’s pain was at its worst, although he tried valiantly not to show it. And they were at the point in his recovery when Miss Cecelia warned the risk of infection was at its greatest. 
Rachel was prepared to spend yet another night on the couch beside her child, alternating between trying to sleep, trying to pray, and worrying herself out of her mind. But before she headed back to the living room, she just needed five minutes to herself.
She glanced around her bedroom, trying to focus on anything besides Tic and his horrible injury, but everything her eyes landed on made her recoil, like the way Tic’s leg stiffened and his breath caught in his lungs every time she and Miss Cecelia changed his bandages. 
On her dresser sat the ballerina music box, which Rachel hadn’t had the heart to open since Tic first gave it to her. On her husband’s nightstand, Caleb’s Charles Spurgeon devotional, one that she had sold him back when they first met at that little Christian bookstore, now so many years out of business. Besides that, the keys to his truck, forgotten and useless. His nail clippers, his back scratcher, the prescription-grade lotion he applied when the winter chill would crack open his skin.
And now where was he?
Her husband was supposed to arrive at Buster’s the very same day he left home. What happened? Had they run into car trouble? Were he and Griz trying to make the journey, treacherous as it was, by foot? 
Or had something even worse happened? 
Radio chatter mentioned rumors of ambushes and lootings in the more populated parts of the state. What if someone had come across Caleb and Griz with the station wagon and all their supplies and ...
A timid knock on her door startled her out of her spiral. “Mrs. Winters?”
Rachel had gotten so adept at hiding her emotions, even from herself, that she couldn’t recall if she’d been crying or not. She wiped her face just in case, then like a child caught stealing sweets from the cookie jar, she hurried to the door.
“AJ? Are you all right?”
The young girl didn’t say anything. Didn’t meet her gaze, but stared past Rachel’s shoulder until Rachel finally asked, “Do you want to come in?”
Looking relieved, AJ hurried inside, shut the door, then stood staring as if she had no idea what to do next.
Rachel sat down at the foot of the bed and patted the mattress. “Have a seat. What can I do for you?”
AJ bit her lip. “Um, it’s about Tic. I wanted to make sure he was gonna be okay?”
Rachel did her best to offer a reassuring smile. Everyone was worried. Everyone was exhausted. 
Rachel didn’t hold the lease on suffering.
“Yeah, honey. Miss Cecelia really knows what she’s doing, and she seems happy with the way he’s healing up. He’ll be in a decent amount of pain for a bit longer, but he’s going to make a perfect recovery.”
AJ let out her breath. “That’s good. I’ve been really worried. And, um, I was wondering ... Is he mad at me?”
Rachel gawked at the poor girl. “Mad at you? What for?”
AJ stared at her hands fidgeting in her lap. “Because if my uncle ...”
Rachel shook her head. If she had known AJ was worrying about this, she would have put the girl’s heart at ease the very first day she came here to live with them.
“None of your uncle’s behavior is your fault. Besides, what Tic did for you, he would’ve done for anyone.”
The moment she said the words, AJ’s countenance dropped, and Rachel realized her mistake. “I mean,” she tried to correct, “Tic has a really big heart, and he wouldn’t even think about blaming you. Not in the least.”
AJ’s features seemed to relax, if only slightly. She sat for so long in silence that Rachel was trying to think of a polite way to see if she needed anything else without sounding dismissive. 
Finally, AJ looked directly into Rachel’s eyes. “You aren’t mad at me, are you?”
The question caught her off guard, but she smiled sadly and shook her head. “Nobody is mad at you. I can promise you that.”
“But you have so many people here, and my brother and me are…” Rachel stared at the door.
“You and your brother are welcome here,” she interrupted. “As guests, and as friends, and as members of this household. Okay?”
“’Cause Junior and I were talking earlier,” AJ went on, as if she hadn’t heard anything Rachel just said. “Maybe it’s time we went back to our uncle’s?”
“Do you want to go back?” 
Immediately, fear clouded AJ’s eyes, and she shook her head.
That settled it. “As far as I’m concerned,” Rachel insisted, “you and your brother have as much right to be here as Tic or I do. All right?”
AJ gave a little nod. “I just wish I knew ...” Her voice trailed off, and Rachel waited. “I wish I knew why any of this was happening, know what I mean?”
At that moment, AJ wasn’t Tic’s friend or a troubled teen Rachel had taken in. She was a hurting soul in search of answers. 
Answers that Rachel didn’t have. 
“Let me ask you something,” she began, tentatively testing this conversational turn. “You believe in God, right?”
AJ nodded sincerely.
“And do you believe that God loves you and promises to look out for you?”
AJ nodded again, albeit with less enthusiasm. 
Rachel reached toward the nightstand and grabbed her husband’s devotional. “This book is by a man named Charles Spurgeon. He was a pastor a long time ago, and he loved Jesus, but that didn’t keep him safe from bad things. One night, he was preaching and thousands of people were there. Someone shouted that there was a fire, and it caused a stampede that killed a lot of his congregants. These were members of his church that he felt responsible for protecting. So, he got really depressed and felt like it was all his fault.”
AJ stared attentively at the devotional but didn’t say anything.
“Charles Spurgeon had a lot of questions, too,” Rachel continued, handing her the book, “and he wrote a lot of them down. I don’t pretend to have all the answers for you, and I’ve been wondering just like you why God would allow us to be going through everything we are. But I know that when the Bible says God works all things together for good, it’s the truth. And I know that if we keep on having faith in him and trusting him to guide our steps, he’ll walk beside us, no matter what.”
A gentle smile softened AJ’s young features. She clutched the devotional as if it contained the treasures of the universe. “Thank you, Mrs. Winters.”
Rachel gave her knee a small squeeze.
“No, AJ. Thank you.”  


25. NIGHTMARES

Rachel woke up with a start. Her bedroom was freezing, and yet she lay drenched in sweat.
She reached her arm out before remembering Cammy was still in the living room. Even if her dog was able to maneuver the stairs on her own, nothing could compel her to abandon her post on Tic’s chest. 
Until tonight, Rachel had kept vigil every night next to her son on the couch. But now, over a week since his injury, the most dangerous risk of infection had passed. The pain no longer kept Tic awake for hours at a time, and yesterday Miss Cecelia had insisted Rachel go upstairs to sleep in her own room for a change.
It had been a terrible mistake.
Her nightmare had felt so real, and she was still panting from fear. The sounds … the smell … 
Never in her entire life would she forget that smell. 
She’d had this same dream for over a decade, should be used to it by now. But this time, the grotesque images from her past morphed with the sight of her son bleeding onto the snow, the horrible gash in his leg, the violence of his attack and the brutal anger of his assailant. 
Her brain was trapped in last week, but her body was convinced she was back in that terrible summer so long ago.
She had attended the church campout for years, practically knew the main trails by heart. Still, it wasn’t the smartest thing for her to have ventured out alone with her toddler. But Tic had been napping, and at that age it always took him way too long to wake up. Yaya had gone ahead with Caleb and several of the other families to pick the wild blueberries the site was famous for. Rachel couldn’t have been more than twenty minutes behind them.
And still …
Haunted, she grabbed the flashlight from her nightstand and shined it around her bedroom. Why did the cursed stench linger even now?
Tic didn’t want to hold her hand on the trail. He was at the stage of stubborn independence that terrified Rachel to the very core of her being. She hadn’t slept well last night. Yaya had eaten too many s’mores and complained of a tummy ache. By the time she emptied her system and Tic finally came down from his sugar high, Rachel was exhausted. But a swarm of mosquitoes kept her awake for several more hours with their incessant, intolerable droning.
And now she was late for berry picking, frustrated at Tic for taking so long to wake up, tired with herself for feeling so tired. She didn’t have the energy to fight her son, who kept on running ahead of her on the trail. Her body was at that sluggish stage where each step felt toilsome and labored and took ten times more effort than it should have.
Tic, well-rested from his nap and now fully awake, was unstoppable. “Look at me, Mommy! I’m gonna run ahead to that tree! Watch how fast!”
The worst part? Rachel felt relieved to have him off her hands. He was never that far ahead, never more than a few yards away … Okay, more than a few yards, but she could always see him, never let him get beyond the point where her voice would carry if she yelled.
But then the odor. A putrid mix of swamp and manure and wet dog and wild beast. Even now, with her son closer to an adult than a little boy, it was the stench she recalled most vividly.
“Tic!”
Her family was Alaskan through and through. She knew all the right things to do: Raise your hands over your head. Speak calmly. Don’t shout. Don’t turn your back.
And never, ever run.
But she made every single mistake. Because how do you not run when your toddler is hurrying obliviously toward a brown bear and her cub? How do you not scream when that’s the only way you have to communicate the danger he’s in?
“Tic!”
He didn’t understand. He turned to her, scared and confused. He still didn’t see.
She was running now. Breathless and panting without anything to show for it. Like sprinting up the wrong escalator or wading through drying cement. No matter how much effort she exerted, she could never get any closer to her son. In her haste, she tripped, twisted her ankle, knocked her breath out, stumbled up, and kept on racing.
But she was too late.
The bear had already attacked. Warning grunts became a roar, silenced by an inhuman squeal. 
At first Rachel thought it was her son’s death shriek, then realized that demonic noise came from the sow herself.
The creature’s back was to her. All Rachel could see was its slashing claws, the angle of its neck as it tossed her little boy aside, floppy like an adult-sized ragdoll. She screamed for Caleb. She screamed for Jesus. She screamed for Tic. 
And then there he was, clutching her leg, crying.
It didn’t make sense.
“Mommy! Mommy!”
She collapsed on the dirt, running her hands up and down her perfect child, trying to find the injury, trying to stop the bleeding. 
But he was unharmed. Completely and inexplicably intact.
For a moment, she blamed it on a miracle, as if after allowing Tic to get mauled, God himself had changed his mind and simply rewound the universe.
“Mommy! Mommy!”
The truth unraveled in pieces, the relief of finding her son safe clashing with the fear, the confusion. Because something terrible was happening just a few feet away. The sow was still slashing, still fighting. 
Still killing. 
And yet Tic was here, secure in her arms.
Rachel screamed at the sound of the gunshot, but she couldn’t hear herself. And then more smells mingling with the putrid animal’s — blood and dust and gunpowder. 
Salty, dirty tears on her cheeks. A crowd. Clamoring and pandemonium. A second gunshot, again at a deafeningly close range.
A huddled mass. Faces she recognized but didn’t see. They weren’t crouching around the dying bear. They were tending to the dying man.
In her dreams and in her memories, Rachel could never figure out how Griz ended up materializing between Tic and the sow. She never saw him on the trail. Back then, all Rachel knew about Griz was that he was a retired Marine, living far off-grid, a recluse who occasionally made an appearance at their church. 
To this day, she didn’t even know if he had come to join the campout or if he’d ventured out on the trail by himself.
But he was there. And he reached her son before Rachel could. Before the bear could.
Before it would have been too late.
This was the point in Rachel’s memories where the story always faded. She couldn’t recall how Griz looked or who provided him with immediate assistance. She learned after the fact that it was her husband who ran to the camp office to call for help, but she had no recollection of any of it.
What she did recall, after the sheer relief at her little boy’s safety, was the guilt. She should have been more careful. She should have been more attentive. She should have forced Tic to hold her hand, no matter how hard he yanked, how loud he whined, how safe the path looked.
But her son had wanted to run, and she had been too tired to argue. And Griz was the one who suffered.
She did everything she could fathom to try to make it right. She offered to help with medical bills, but Veteran Affairs covered his week-long hospital stay. Once Griz was discharged, she cooked him soups that she begged Caleb to deliver because she couldn’t stand the sight of his injuries. 
Nothing would assuage her guilt. The years passed. Griz and her husband grew close, sometimes out on the trails Griz loved, sometimes at church events when he decided to stop by. Tic grew up to admire the strange mountain man from a respectful distance.
And Rachel’s nightmares never ceased.

For the moment, the only thing that was able to take Yaya’s mind off her hunger was her best friend’s tears.
“They’re sure it was him?” Yaya asked.
Lilly buried her head against Yaya’s chest and sobbed. “He was sure.” 
That morning, just like always, Lilly had braved the cold to walk to the student union. There was no food left to distribute around campus anymore, but the walls and windows had turned into a massive bulletin board where people would leave messages, looking for friends or telling their families where they’d gone. Lilly checked every day for any sign or news or notes from Kai, and today she’d learned the truth.
Lilly had run into Kai’s roommate, who said her boyfriend had died the night of the cell phone explosions. 
Yaya prayed it had been quick and painless. Not like her own roommate’s had been …
But she wouldn’t think about that now. And she wouldn’t think about the gnawing hunger in her gut, the emptiness that left her weak and dizzy. 
Right now, she needed to comfort Lilly.
There was nothing she could tell her friend to take her pain away, nothing she could do to ease the trauma and the tragedy and the horror. For over a week, Yaya had secretly wished for Lilly to give up hope that Kai was alive. But now that she held her collapsed friend in her arms, now that she carried the weight of Lilly’s sorrow, Yaya realized how wrong she’d been.
How wrong she’d been about everything.

Rattled and exhausted, Rachel was relieved when Dev finally took the kids outside. Convinced that teens needed stimulation and activity to stay sharp, Dev had established a daily routine that combined recreational training and physical fitness with history, science, and Bible classes thrown in for good measure. Today, they were testing the new snowshoes they’d designed.
Rachel was thankful the kids had something productive to focus on, even more so for the pause in her day that allowed her to breathe just a bit in her own home. Having so many random people living under her roof meant that she never felt fully at peace, fully relaxed. Her own personal sanctuary had turned into a sanctuary for others. In a way, it was like the start of every summer, when her husband and her kids came home from school and Rachel stopped having the house to herself for long quiet stretches at a time. The shift was jarring every single year, and it was even more jarring now.
Today, Miss Cecelia was in the living room, helping Tic with his rehabilitation. Three times a day, she’d stand over him at the couch and move his leg this way and his hip that, doing what she could to keep his muscles strong and scar tissue loose. Rachel could tell the exercises were painful, but her son never complained. She knew he was far more concerned about returning to his heavy squats than a little discomfort.
Angel carried Leo in a sling she’d made from an old curtain and was in the kitchen, tending to a sourdough starter she’d worked up.
“No, sweetie,” she told Leo in a soft, maternal voice. “It’s not time to eat right now. You already had your breakfast. Now you’re going to have to wait for lunch.” Every day, Dani’s baby was delighted to test his newly developed eating skills, and Angel had already taught him the baby sign for food. Rachel was surprised that a six-month-old could learn so fast, even more shocked at how insistent Leo’s demands became once he discovered this new way to communicate.
After Tic finished his range of motion activities, he started doodling in his sketch pad. He was able to sit up on the couch now, and his energy levels had improved as well. Before long, his biggest problem would be the boredom and not the pain.
“How are you doing, buddy?” Rachel asked, sitting gently beside him on the couch.
Tic didn’t look up at her. “Fine.”
She glanced down at his drawing, a dark woods with a shadowy figure, ominous and angry. “Do you need anything? Are you hungry?”
“I’m fine,” he repeated. Rachel didn’t know what to say. For a full week after his attack, she’d never left his side, not even to sleep. She sensed he needed her, and she needed him just as badly. But now, there was a hesitance, a reluctance. He was broody, maybe even angry. Of course, that was natural for someone in Tic’s situation.
Except it wasn’t natural for Tic. He was always so easy-going, always so open, always willing to share what was on his mind as well as what was on his heart. Dick hadn’t just scarred her son’s thigh.
He’d left a jagged wound in Tic’s soul. A wound Rachel feared might never heal.
She sat by her son for a moment longer, then got up. She’d been waiting all morning to talk with Miss Cecelia, and now was as good a time as any.
Miss Cecelia, whose cough had grown progressively worse, sat in the dining room where they’d moved Caleb’s La-Z-Boy. She was staring blankly out the window when Rachel sidled up beside her. 
“I have a favor to ask you.” 
Miss Cecelia didn’t respond, just lifted an eyebrow to indicate she was listening. 
Rachel felt her face flush and managed to stammer, “Caleb left his rifle here, but I don’t know how to use it.”
A few minutes later, the two women were upstairs in Rachel’s bedroom. “So this is an assault rifle?” Rachel asked, staring at Caleb’s AR-15 laid out on her bed.
Miss Cecelia made a sound that was a combination of a laugh and a snort. “Maybe that’s what a bleeding heart in the Lower 48 would call it. I call it bear protection. And by bear, I mean bear … and other two-legged predators.”
Rachel didn’t respond. The sleek, black gun looked so out of place on her pink and lavender bedspread. Caleb, she wondered, is this really what you want me to be doing? 
“All right.” Miss Cecelia picked the rifle up with two hands and held it out to her. “First thing you gotta realize is it’s heavier than you expect.” Without warning, she plopped it into Rachel’s arms. “See?”
Rachel struggled to keep from dropping the apparatus and nodded.
“Feel its weight,” Miss Cecelia instructed, and Rachel imagined herself a second-grader in Miss Cecelia’s Sunday school class, except now instead of listening to a story about the loaves and the fish, she was learning how to work a weapon designed to kill.
For years, Caleb had wanted to teach her how to shoot. And for years, she’d refused. Yes, there was a small part of her that understood the hypocrisy. In a home invasion, she would have been thankful to have Caleb and his firearm, yet not willing to wield it herself.
But Rachel had her reasons. Reasons she hadn’t even ever explained to Caleb. Not fully.
She set the rifle back on her floral bedspread.
“This is your magazine,” Miss Cecelia told her, popping out a metal box stacked with bullets and then clicking it back into place. Rachel wondered at the way the old woman could handle everything so smoothly. Wasn’t she afraid the gun would go off? Wasn’t she afraid of what she might do with it, who she might hurt?
Maybe it was because of that phase Caleb went through where he watched all those detective shows on TV, but Rachel didn’t even want to get her fingerprints on it.
Miss Cecelia hefted the rifle to her shoulder as if it were no lighter than a cardigan. “Now, when you’re ready, you load it by sliding the charging handle back like this.” The mechanism snapped in place with an angry clack. “Then you look down the scope, and when you’ve got the target in your sight, all you do is pull the trigger.”
Rachel braced herself, as if the rifle might discharge right here in her bedroom. Instead, Miss Cecelia thrust the gun back into Rachel’s arms. “Here. Your turn.”
Rachel tried to figure out how to balance the rifle with one hand while manipulating the handle with the other. She would never get used to this heavy, awkward, deadly appendage. 
“It doesn’t rest on top of your shoulder,” Miss Cecelia chided. “You do that and the scope’ll give you a black eye worse than what Dick Jacobson gave to your boy.” 
Rachel felt her body tense, but Miss Cecelia’s words reminded her why she was up here doing this in the first place. 
Without any regard to modesty or personal space, Miss Cecelia slapped her palm against Rachel’s chest then maneuvered the rifle. 
“You want it pressed up solid right between your shoulder and armpit. Just like this. Now you make sure you’re looking at your target straight through the scope right here. Some people like to keep both eyes open. I usually just use one. Before I leave for the food bank, we’ll go outside to practice and you’ll find what works for you.”
Rachel didn’t want to take the rifle outside and practice. She didn’t want to touch or even lay eyes on the thing again. But then visions of Dick Jacobson straddling her son flashed through her mind, steadying her resolve.
“All right,” she said, steadying the heavy object in her hands. “Once Dev and the kids get home, let’s go outside and test it out.”
 


26. MONTAGE

“There you go,” Miss Cecelia told Tic. “You tighten your quad like that, take a deep breath for the count of four, and let it out. Now again.” She poked and prodded his upper thigh, still sore and bruised, but Tic forced himself not to squirm. 
“Again,” she demanded.
Tic’s pulse was racing as fast as if he were running suicide drills on the basketball court. His body wanted him to stop. His torn muscle fibers begged for him to stop. The site where AJ’s uncle slashed open a gaping wound in his thigh shrieked for him to stop.
But Tic wouldn’t stop.
“You ready for a break?” Mom asked, carrying in the chess board.
Tic shook his head. So did Miss Cecelia, who looked at him and simply ordered, “Again.”

***

“Here, Miss Cecelia. I got you some hot water and dissolved a cough drop in it. My mom always did that for me when I wasn’t feeling well. It’s like drinking liquid Vicks.”
Miss Cecelia reached out and took the mug.
Rachel frowned. “I’m worried about you,” she admitted when she saw the way the old woman’s hand shook. “You’re working so hard,” she pressed. “Taking care of Leo and Tic and going to the food bank. And your cough hasn’t gotten better at all.”
Miss Cecelia waved her hand dismissively in the air. “My mother was 97 years old when she died.”
Rachel remembered the announcement made at church when it happened, but couldn’t guess why Miss Cecelia brought it up. “That was a while ago, right?” she asked.
Miss Cecelia nodded. “During COVID. She was in a nursing home in Anchorage. It was the day the lockdown started. Friday the 13th. The nurses say she went to bed that night and never woke up.”
Rachel didn’t know how she was expected to respond. “It sounds like she died peacefully,” she attempted.
Miss Cecelia harrumphed. “She died because at her age, battling lockdown orders and a global pandemic and the uncertainty of the future wasn’t worth the effort.”
Miss Cecelia held her gaze, and Rachel’s stomach dropped. “Miss Cecelia, you aren’t saying that you …”
Another flick of her wrist to silence Rachel’s protests. “I tell God every night that when he wants me to come home, I’m ready. And until then, I’ll keep doing my best with whatever he has for me to be piddling away with down here. To be honest, I don’t know why he’s kept me around for this long.”
“We need you here for Tic,” Rachel argued. “Cammy, too. I would have no idea how to help either of them if you weren’t around. And the food bank …”
Miss Cecelia grunted. “Don’t listen to me. I’m just a rambling old woman.” 
She took another sip from her mug. 
“That’s good stuff. Bless her soul, your mom was a very smart woman.” She shook her head and let out a quiet chuckle. “Cough-drop tea. Who would’ve imagined?”

***

“Come on, Big Guy! You can do it!” 
Baby Leo stared at the smiling, cheering faces around the living room, wiggled his bottom proudly, and rocked once more on all fours.
“That boy’ll be crawling any day, mark my words,” Miss Cecelia declared, her voice tender with pride and unfamiliar affection.
“We’ll have to baby-proof the main level.”
“Not just the main level. Yesterday I caught him trying to follow Benji up the stairs.”
AJ grinned. “He’s so little to be getting so big!” 

***

“Look! Look at this!” Junior shouted, scrambling through the arctic entrance, followed by Dev and the teens. “Come see what we finally got!”
Angel and Rachel were in the living room, where they’d just started working on a Norman Rockwell puzzle. Rachel stood up and squirmed when she saw what Junior was holding.
“We caught it in the snare!” he announced proudly. “Our first rabbit!”
“It’s a hare,” his sister corrected, but even AJ looked pleased with their success.
Cammy, who was now able to walk stiffly with a limp, sauntered over and gave the creature a few curious sniffs before returning to Tic on the couch. 
“Cool catch,” Tic said, glancing up from his sketchpad, but Rachel could hear there was no true happiness or joy in his voice.

***

Days meant nothing to Yaya anymore. While other students diligently exed out squares on a large desk calendar, Yaya found the ritual completely pointless. The world would never go back to how it had been before. With the sinking in of her ribcage and cheekbones, it grew ever more apparent that nobody like FEMA or the Red Cross or the Avengers would swoop down from helicopters and save the world. Nobody was coming to help them.
They were on their own.
At least she had Boone. He’d organized their little group of eight into a small chosen family. Zeke was the academic, a history buff who kept trying to draw parallels from what was happening today to other world events and catastrophes. The food shortage and harsh winter were no worse than what Russians endured during the Siege of Leningrad, the exploding cell phones like the attack on Hezbollah pagers. The grid crash was a textbook example of what so many Americans expected to experience during the Cold War, its aftermath like the panic and looting during the New York City blackout in the 1970s.
While Zeke pontificated about the past, Ozzie kept the group entertained with his random store of useless trivia and deadpan delivery. He had the largest repertoire of film and TV knowledge of the group and liked to share interesting storylines from an obscure sitcom or favorite indie film, and if Lilly was bored, she could simply ask him for his opinions about aliens or flat-earthers.
And during it all, Yaya stayed next to Boone. Maybe it was trauma bonding. Maybe it was something else. But ever since she saw him unconscious in his lab, she’d grown to realize how much he meant to her, how empty her life would feel without him by her side.
Sometimes she’d catch him staring at her with a depth to his gaze that nearly sucked her breath away, that made her want to find any way possible to steal a quiet minute together with him. He had a dimple on his left cheek she’d never noticed before.
While their roommates played cards or discussed conspiracies, she and Boone would slip away to their favorite sectional. Surrounded by everyone else, they enjoyed time together in their own private world, where the flame flickering from a Bunsen burner warmed Yaya’s skin, and the company she was with warmed both her heart and her soul.

***

Same setting, different dream. The smells are identical. The sounds. But this time Tic is older. And long before the danger becomes imminent, he sees the bear. Even before the sow charges, he’s climbed a tree to get away.
Good boy, Rachel thinks to herself, and then she looks down. Why is she holding her husband’s rifle?
“It’s loaded for bear,” Caleb says, but she can’t see him.
Curiously, she’s not afraid. Not really. More like pleasantly surprised as she stares down at the weapon. This could come in handy.
She hefts the AR-15 onto her shoulder, and the heavy awkward thing doesn’t feel quite so heavy or quite so awkward. 
“Now line your target up in your scope.” Miss Cecelia has materialized by Rachel’s side. “Either close one eye or keep them both open. It’s up to you.”
The bear is making that grunting, panting, snorting noise. She hasn’t even started to roar. She’s closer to the tree now, but Tic’s high up. He’s older and stronger and has found shelter in the top branches.
He’s safe.
Maybe I don’t have to shoot her at all, Rachel thinks with relief.
“You’ve got to act now.” Miss Cecelia is adamant. 
So is Caleb, who’s still invisible but is shouting at her nonetheless. “Shoot while you’ve got her in your sights.”
“It’s either kill her or watch her kill your son.”
“Don’t think. Do it.”
“It’s just like we practiced.”
“Pull the trigger.”
Except she hesitates, and now the sow is scampering up the tree. Rachel didn’t even know brown bears could climb, definitely not that high or nearly that fast. She knows what she has to do. But Tic is right there. What if she misses and shoots her son instead?
“Why are you waiting?” Caleb shouts. “Kill her!”
“Mommy!” Tic yells, his voice full of fear. “Help me.” He’s a small child now, just a helpless toddler. He starts to cry, wondering why his mom can’t save him. Won’t save him.
Rachel thrusts the rifle at Miss Cecelia, but the old woman refuses it. “You know what you have to do.”
Rachel closes one eye. Then opens it again. 
“Mommy!” Tic continues to plead through his terrified sobs. “Help me!”
But every time the bear is in her sights, so is her son. 
Nice and steady. Now Caleb’s calm voice is right behind her, like he’s an invisible phantom whispering in her ear, helping her aim. Nice and steady, he repeats, and his reassuring tone grants her the resolve she needs.
She shuts one eye. Then the other. 
Then both.
She squeezes the trigger.
“Mommy! No!”
“Tic!” she screams and sits up in bed with a jolt. Her heart is racing. Her bed sheets are in knots and tangles. Her nightclothes are drenched in perspiration.
And in her nostrils — that hideous, unmistakable stench.

***

“Are you sure you’re not going to hurt yourself doing that?” Mom asked.
Before he got stabbed in the thigh with a hunting knife, Tic might have rolled his eyes at her, but now he understood Mom’s fear and her love for him so much more than he ever had.
“Miss Cecelia said it’s fine, as long as I’m not putting any weight on my leg or feel any pain.”
“I still don’t like it,” Mom fussed. She had always been a worrywart, but ever since Dick’s attack …
“I promise I’ll be careful,” he told her. The truth was Tic couldn’t not lift weights. Even if the weights in question were the silly little two-pound things Mom bought back when she did those low-impact Pilates workouts on YouTube.
Back when there was YouTube.
But something was better than nothing, and anything was better than lying around all day letting every single muscle in his body atrophy.
He started with basic bicep curls, surprised at how quickly he tired out, even when using Mom’s dainty little dumbbells. But Dad had always emphasized the importance of small gains. 
Something is better than nothing, Tic repeated to himself.
Mom hadn’t stopped staring. “Does it hurt?” she asked.
He winced, out of frustration instead of pain, then forced a smile. “No. It feels good to move.”
Benji clambered up from the basement, where he’d gone to grab some actual weights. “Hey, gimp,” he said, giving Tic his usual sarcastic greeting.
“Better be careful,” Tic joked and patted his leg. “Once I can stand up on this baby, you’re gonna be sorry.”
Benji quivered in mock terror. “That’s so scary,” he said then started in on his lateral raises.
Tic hated that he was still cooped up in the living room every day. Hated that he was stuck doing bicep curls with girly two-pound weights. 
But the rhythmic motion was soothing and familiar.
This one’s for you, Dad, Tic thought and took another rep.

***

“Looks like Tic’s recovering really well,” Angel said. She and Rachel were in the kitchen, filleting a couple of trout Dev and the kids had brought home after a morning ice fishing in the cold.
“He is,” Rachel agreed. “Miss Cecelia said he might be ready to start hobbling around on crutches before too long.”
“I can’t picture Tic hobbling,” Angel replied with a chuckle. She sprinkled some salt and garlic powder on the fillet then looked at her work for a moment before adding, “He’s doing a great job keeping his spirits up.”
Rachel didn’t respond. Yes, on the outside, Tic appeared to be the same easygoing child everyone in Glennallen admired. But she knew her son, sensed intuitively and decidedly that something within him had shifted the night of Dick’s attack.
What she couldn’t admit, even to herself, was her fear that he would never be the same again, that the scars on his soul were engraved there permanently.
The women worked together in silence until the front door opened with a clang. At first, Rachel assumed it was the teens coming in from outside, but it was Dev and Miss Cecelia, home from the food bank.
“What are you doing back so soon?” Angel asked her husband.
“We closed early,” Miss Cecelia answered for him, her eyes set, her voice even more gruff than normal.
“Is everything okay?” Rachel asked.
“Oh, sure,” Miss Cecelia spat sarcastically. “As long as you don’t mind some men holding you at gunpoint with their Glock and taking the last boxes of meat.” She turned her ire onto Dev. “Of course, if we brought the rifle like any smart, sane person would have, we wouldn’t be in this trouble, would we?”
Rachel felt as if her mind was glitching. “Gunpoint?” she asked, backing up. Had she heard right?
“Why don’t you both sit down?” Angel suggested, the gentleness of saints and angels oozing from her voice as she wiped her hands dry. “Start from the beginning and tell us what happened.” 
“It’s not as bad as it sounds,” Dev assured his wife. “Some men came in waving around a gun. It was all for show. They wanted the rest of the Spam and canned chicken, so we gave it to them.”
“It wasn’t Dick Jacobson again, was it?” Rachel asked, surprised at the hatred welling up at the mention of that horrible name.
Dev shook his head. “They were from out of town.”
“So you gave them the last of the canned meat?” Rachel pressed.
“We only had a few cases left anyway.” Dev shrugged his shoulders. “And I encouraged them to take a Bible and a gospel tract with them, too.”
Miss Cecelia let out a caustic chortle. “They’ll probably use the pages in their outhouse.”
Dev reached out a hand and laid it placatingly on Miss Cecelia’s elbow. “Nothing in that food bank was ever ours to begin with.”
She jerked her arm away. “No, it belonged to the members of this community. And now they’ll have nothing.”
If Rachel hadn’t known her better, she might have thought Miss Cecelia was about to cry.
“I’m just glad neither of you were hurt.” Angel sighed.
Miss Cecelia waved her hand in the air dismissively. “We wouldn’t have been in any danger at all if I had the AR-15 with me.”
“Those who live by the sword die by the sword,” Dev quoted, but nobody responded.
Angel walked over to her husband and wrapped him in a hug. Miss Cecelia stared at the wall as if she could permanently burn it with the fire of her feelings toward Dev, her anger over all that lost food. 
Rachel glanced toward the living room where she’d last seen Tic napping with Cammy on his chest. Had he overheard everything?
“The Bible tells us to give to those in need,” Dev said, his voice imploring as if he needed to find someone to affirm his actions.
Rachel didn’t know what to think. Of course, she hated the idea of violence, but surely it wasn’t fair to give all their resources to the men with the scariest weapons when the whole town was equally suffering. 
“Next time we go back, I go back armed,” Miss Cecelia declared.
Dev straightened his spine. “Then I can’t go with you,” he responded resolutely.
“Fine,” Miss Cecelia spat out, looking smug and somewhat pleased. “Rachel, you and I will go together.”
And that’s how it came to be that three afternoons a week, both women would sling rifles onto their shoulders, pass out food to the residents of Glennallen, and keep the food bank doors open to the public.
The outsiders with the Glock never returned.

“So your parents did research for the military? On that AI stuff you were talking about?” Yaya wasn’t sure she believed him, but Boone had never lied to her before. This wasn’t a hunger hallucination, was it? 
She’d lost weight, but she hadn’t lost her mind. 
Boone leaned his face closer to hers so that their cheeks were nearly touching. Behind them, Ozzie and Zeke were in the middle of a heated discussion about the newest rumors circulating that what remained of the Alaska-based military was regrouping to provide aid. The idea was preposterous to Yaya, but then again, so was the idea of surviving an entire winter stuck here in the GI lab with her professor.
“Swear on my life,” Boone responded. “It was all super top-secret. My parents couldn’t leave the site without a ton of special clearances. Once my dad needed to go under anesthesia for an abscessed tooth and they sent him with two men-in-black Feds to make sure he didn’t give away any confidential information.”
His blue eyes twinkled mischievously. Even if he was totally joking with her, she was spellbound by his story.
“Where were you? Area 51 or something like that?”
He leaned even closer. His forehead touched hers. “No, even more remote. A big Silo outside of Gakona. That’s your neck of the woods, isn’t it?”
Yaya stared at him incredulously. How had she known him all this time and he’d never mentioned he’d grown up in her backyard? The revelation made him that much more fascinating. Still, what he was saying made no sense. 
“There aren’t any military installations in Gakona,” she stated. 
Boone’s eyes were cloudy, and she was sucked into their mystery, thankful he was sharing such a deeply concealed part of himself. “We were underground.”
Now he was definitely messing with her.
Boone chuckled quietly, a shared joke just between the two of them. “You don’t believe me, do you? I swear I’m serious.” Again that dimple. The earnestness in his blemish-free face that made her forget the hunger pangs, if only for a moment.
She nudged his elbow. “All right. Where in Gakona were you, then?”
“You know that big field with the huge antenna array?”
Her eyes widened. “You lived at SPEAR? I thought all those rumors about military research there were conspiracy theories.” 
Another subdued laugh. She could listen to that sound forever. Their arms were pressed up close together. Yaya’s palms grew sweaty, and she didn’t want to think about how long it’d been since she’d brushed her teeth. Even the peppermints and gum they’d scoured from the vending machines were long gone.
But when Boone looked into her eyes and held her gaze, none of that seemed to matter.

“Psalm 91 gives us the assurance that whatever is going on in the world, we can face it with courage and faith.” 
Rachel sat transfixed while Dev’s face practically shined during their evening devotions. 
The days were getting longer now, and this was the first night Dev read from Scripture with nothing but the light streaming in from the window.
“You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday.” Dev glanced up dramatically from his worn Bible.
From her seat nearest the stove, Miss Cecelia let out a loud, wet cough.
“A thousand may fall at your side,” Dev continued, his voice rising to a passionate crescendo, “ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.”
He shut his Bible and let his eyes rest on every individual seated around the living room in turn. “It will not come near you,” he emphasized. “Just like Paul tells us, neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God. Nothing in all creation. That includes this grid failure. That includes everything happening around the world. That includes Tic’s leg and Miss Cecelia’s cough and all our sorrows and all our fears and all our uncertainties.” 
Rachel gazed at her husband’s study Bible in her lap, her heart holding tightly to Dev’s words of comfort and encouragement. These evening gatherings were the short, nearly miraculous reprieve from her anxiety and worry. She let her eyes gaze on those seated around her living room: Tic with his leg raised in front of him, bruises fading, his black eye now turned to yellow. The Singh and the Jacobson kids, guests in Rachel’s home who felt like family more and more each day. Leo, who had just discovered how to crawl, and Cammy, who looked upon the tiny human with unbridled maternal affection and pride. When the dog wasn’t velcroed to Tic’s side, she was licking food off Leo’s face or lying next to him on the floor. Even with her stiff shoulder, she made sure to follow him every time he tested out his new ambulatory skills.
For half an hour every evening, Rachel’s life and heart and living room were full.
“Holy Week will be here soon,” Dev went on. “During our morning Bible study, the children and I have been discussing the fact that Jesus’ death, not just his resurrection, should be the focus of our thoughts and fervent attention, and every day we should be meditating on the unthinkable sacrifice he made for us while he hung on that cross to take upon himself the punishment for all of our sins.”
He let his eyes rest on the teens. “The kids have been put in charge of preparing all our special services next week, starting with Palm Sunday. Each child here has taken on special roles that showcase their own unique and God-given talents and abilities.”
Rachel was glad to have Dev with them. Yes, he was stubborn and perhaps a bit naïve. Sometimes Rachel worried that if Dick Jacobson or any other ne’er-do-well showed up on her front porch, Dev would hand over all the food in her house if they simply asked for it. Still, she was grateful the children were getting such regular spiritual input. Heaven knew her soul was too weary to provide them much of anything other than shelter, weighed down as she was by worry for Caleb and their daughter. 
And then at night, while Dev encouraged them all with inspiration from the Word, she could feel that heaviness lift off her shoulders.
But then the sun would set, albeit later now each evening. And everyone would head off to their respective abodes, everyone but Tic, taking all the sounds of laughter and joviality with them. For the last few moments of the day, before Rachel crawled into the cold and empty bed she’d once shared with her husband, it was just her and her son in the empty living room. 
And then, away from everyone else’s listening ears and unbearable gazes, Rachel would pull out the ham radio. 
“Buster?” 
“Hi, Rachel. How are things in Glennallen?” The operator’s voice was always kind, always patient, always gentle.
She held her breath. “Any news?”
And then that sigh she knew so well. The sigh that broke her heart into pieces every single night without fail.
“I’m sorry, Rachel. I’ll let you know if I hear anything.”
Some nights she would manage a polite thank you. Others, her throat would constrict and she’d have to kill the battery and rush upstairs before the real tears came. 


27. THE LONE SURVIVOR

Caleb’s only comfort was that his wife didn’t have to see him like this. He’d always known he was out of shape. He just didn’t know how impossible it would be to force his body to push forward, step after step, mile after mile, day after back-breaking day. Meanwhile, his pants grew looser and his soul wearier.
After abandoning the station wagon at the avalanche site, Caleb assumed the first few days would be the hardest. They still had the rest of the mountain to ascend in violently cold weather. Once they reached the summit, once the path along the Richardson began weaving downhill, things had to get easier.
Didn’t they?
When they were lucky, he and Griz hunkered down in abandoned cabins for the night. Caleb would huddle in the cold and think about home, while Griz checked Arsenal’s paws before going back out to hunt for fowl or set snares. 
Their food supply would have been adequate if they weren’t burning thousands of calories just to stay warm, let alone pushing forward through snow and ice and wind on a journey that felt as endless as eternity itself.
On nights when there was no shelter, they pitched Griz’s cold-weather tent and did their best to conserve heat without straight-up spooning. Arsenal, for all he was worth, refused to be touched while he slept or else he might have made a decent body warmer. The animal would suffer the indignity of a short cuddle, some nights even initiating it, but after a few minutes would get up with a disgusted, angry huff. Then he’d curl himself up in the farthest corner of the tent as possible, glaring as if nursing his mortally wounded dignity, before finally tucking his nose under his tail and beginning to snooze.
Griz’s high-tech gear combined with mercifully warmer days on the other side of Summit Pass kept the men from lethal exposure, but not from the discomfort of cracked and bleeding skin or the bone-wearying, soul-destroying exhaustion.
Early into their descent, Griz and Caleb came across a stalled semi in the middle of the highway. The driver’s frozen body was the second corpse Caleb had encountered in as many weeks, but unlike with Dani, now there was no time for a burial or funeral. Instead, Griz removed the unfortunate man’s coat and boots, tossed them in Arsenal’s sled, and handed Caleb a half-eaten bag of potato chips. 
Caleb wasn’t hungry.
One of the unexpected outcomes of their time together was Griz’s willingness to speak more than two or three words at a time. As the mile markers ticked by slowly and the cold burned their skin, Griz spoke about his grandfather, who had been the first missionary to settle in the Copper River Valley, and the young Alaska Native woman he fell in love with and married. 
In spite of Griz’s heritage of faith, Caleb could never put his finger exactly on the pulse of his friend’s beliefs. Maybe he was a cultural Christian who had never made any personal decision to surrender his life to Christ. Maybe he had blended his grandfather’s Christian faith with the animism of his grandmother’s lineage.
Or maybe he was simply a very private man.
But as the days wore on, Griz talked about other aspects of his life as well, like his time in the Marines. Caleb listened attentively while Griz described his tour as a young Marine in Somalia; the friendships and bonds he forged with the others fighting beside him; his later Force Recon missions in Bosnia and Kosovo before 9/11 placed him in multiple back-to-back deployments in the Middle East.
As a history teacher, Caleb was curious to learn about Griz’s firsthand experience in so many major world events, but what he really wanted to know was how an individual could bear witness to so much evil and violence and wickedness and still wake up day after day, still put on that uniform, still believe that this world — in all of its depravity and fallen nature — was something worth defending.
It was a mystery Griz never explained. Or maybe Caleb simply hadn’t found a way to ask the right questions.
After seventeen years on foreign soil, Griz had returned to Alaska to serve as an Arctic warfare specialist, training American troops in cold-weather survival.
“That must have been a nice change from combat,” Caleb said. 
“Best years of my life,” Griz replied.
Caleb was surprised at this uncharacteristically demonstrative display of emotion, but something stopped him from asking the next obvious question: If Griz loved his position so much, why did he quit? For as long as Caleb had known him, Griz had been living off the land and off his retirement, even though he seemed healthy enough to have decades of military service or an entire second career ahead of him.
The answer came one night when the men were about halfway down the mountain. As evening approached with no cabins or abandoned buildings in sight, Caleb asked if Griz needed help pitching their tent. It had become his subtle way of admitting he was too tired to keep on going while still maintaining a small shred of his pride.
“Nah,” Griz answered. “A little bit ahead.”
By now, Caleb understood that a little bit ahead meant something entirely different to his partner than it did to him, and he steeled himself to endure several more hours of walking in spite of the cold and hunger. 
At least he wasn’t starving, not literally. They still had dehydrated meals in their packs, and when they needed it, Griz and Arsenal managed to provide a ptarmigan or snowshoe hare to cook over a fire. But that certainly wasn’t a cheeseburger or a greasy egg-and-bacon breakfast. Caleb had the extra pounds to spare, but was still faced with a profound calorie deficit at the end of every day, not to mention the monotony that came from eating nothing but lean game and camp meals.
“Better than MREs,” Griz would comment, but Caleb wasn’t sure. He remembered a military movie that clearly depicted an MRE with a Snickers bar for dessert.
Blown about by strong winds, the snowdrifts grew even deeper than normal.
“Walk in my footsteps,” Griz instructed.
Hauling the loaded sled, Arsenal held his bushy tail high as he strode forward majestically. Every so often, Griz would reach out a gloved hand and tousle the fur on his dog’s neck. Eventually, Griz led them down a side road and past a large sign: Marine Corps Arctic and Alpine Training Center. 
Caleb turned to his friend. “Is this where you used to work?” 
Griz just kept on walking. A rush of relief warmed Caleb’s whole body when a building came into view. A few minutes later, Griz had broken in. Their first stop was the mess hall. Caleb’s eyes widened when he saw enough food to supply a dozen men on a dozen trips from here to Fairbanks and back again. Griz lit a small camp stove and pulled out various #10 cans of ingredients to prepare what Caleb suspected would be a mouth-watering feast, or at the very least a welcome change from dry, crispy ptarmigan. 
Soon, a second glorious realization struck home: there had to be a toilet somewhere here. A real, genuine porcelain toilet. 
He was sick to death of squatting in the snow.
Leaving Griz to his culinary work, Caleb wandered around, shining his flashlight on the plaques and maps and certificates lining the walls. He was heading straight toward a restroom sign when something else caught his attention.
Uncertain he could trust his eyes, he held his flashlight closer to the picture of three men. They were dressed in heavy winter gear and posed in front of a helicopter perched atop a snowy mountain. It was the Marine in the middle that made Caleb completely forget the real purpose of his meandering.
The man had fewer wrinkles, two good eyes and no hint of a scar, but Caleb had grown to know every square inch of that face. 
Griz.
The most surprising part of the photo wasn’t Griz’s young age or how he stood with his arms slung casually over the shoulders of his two friends. It was the bright and joyful smile on his face.
Caleb read the inscription: In Memory of Staff Sgt. Daniel Harker and Cpl. Michael Raines. Beloved teammates, skilled mountaineers, and brothers in arms who gave up their lives to save others. Lost in the Moose’s Tooth Avalanche, but the memory of their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten. 
In a jumbled instant, puzzle pieces scrambled together to form a cohesive image in Caleb’s brain. He knew about the Moose’s Tooth Avalanche. Everyone in Alaska knew about the Moose’s Tooth Avalanche — the deadliest Arctic disaster since the Gold Rush days. A team of mountain climbers, their guide, and a camera crew were filming near Denali National Park when they were buried beneath ten feet of ice and snow. The only reason anyone survived was because a joint Army-Marines training team was working nearby, running cold-weather drills.
During their heroic rescue, a secondary avalanche engulfed the entire area. Four of the civilians were ultimately saved, but of the military responders, the only two who survived were an Army Ranger and the Marines’ team leader.
Griz.
Caleb knew the story. He showed the heart-wrenching documentary every year in his Alaska history class. The film never named the Marine who survived, had it? But even if it did, would Caleb have made the connection and recognized his friend? To everyone in Glennallen, he was simply Griz. Caleb didn’t even know his last name.
The documentary mentioned one of the military survivors taking an early medical retirement due to PTSD. Had they been talking about the Army Ranger or the Marine? 
Caleb was still standing there in solemn, contemplative silence when Griz appeared behind him. “Food’s ready. Macaroni and cheese.” 
Caleb let his eyes linger on the photograph, at Griz’s young and healthy smiling expression, at the joyful faces of his teammates. There was so much he wanted to ask. So much he wanted to know. 
But he knew his friend better than that. The moment he saw the stoic look in Griz’s eye, he swallowed the questions down and forced a smile. “Macaroni and cheese? Sounds delicious. I’m starving.”
That night, the men lay out on actual mattresses, covered in blankets and with a small Sterno-burning stove between them for warmth. Arsenal huffed loudly and paced the floor, looking for a spot to lie down.
“He’s too hot in here,” Griz grumbled.
But Caleb wasn’t thinking about Arsenal. He was thinking about Moose’s Tooth. About his friend and what he must have gone through.
Everything in his body ached, including his gut now that he’d gorged himself on Griz’s macaroni and cheese. The mattress was flat and nearly as thin and flimsy as one of Rachel’s yoga mats, but it would be like sleeping in a palace compared to the outdoors.
Once he managed to fall asleep, anyway.
After all their effort, Delta was still a week away, and after that another hundred miles to Fairbanks. He didn’t bother tracking the date, but he knew Easter would be here soon. His first Easter without his family.
Of course, that also meant spring was coming. But how would the promise of warmer weather help them if they died from hunger or exposure, or simply sheer exhaustion, before the snow melted? In his more dramatic moments, Caleb imagined falling asleep one night in Griz’s tent and never getting back up. He pictured Arsenal trying to nudge him awake, then Griz building another fire to thaw the ground and bury him like they’d done back home for Dani.
Or maybe just leaving his body for the wolves and the ravens.
Caleb’s mind refused to quiet, but he couldn’t tell if that was because of his racing thoughts or because Arsenal was so restless. The dog kept pacing and stifling down a high-pitched whimper. Eventually he walked to the door and let out a long, exaggerated howl.
“Want me to take him outside?” Caleb offered.
“I got him,” Griz muttered and grabbed his flashlight.
As exhausted as his body was, Caleb couldn’t shut off his brain, so he eventually pulled out Tic’s pocket New Testament. He’d given up reading Rachel’s love letters. They were too raw, reminded him too much of home. But the Bible was meant to give him comfort and assurances. He hoped God wouldn’t let him down.
Caleb found himself in the Sermon on the Mount, the same passage he’d quoted in the goodbye letter he’d left at home for his wife.
Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? 
Caleb thought about the abundant supplies surrounding them right now. He would have never known this training center was located out here if Griz hadn’t shown him the way. The fact that he was going to bed with a full belly was a clear sign of God’s abundant provision.
Caleb made a mental note to be more thankful for the wild poultry they had eaten so many nights on the road. He nearly chuckled, comparing himself to the grumbling Israelites in the wilderness. Quail in the desert, ptarmigan in the tundra … in the end it was all the same.
Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life?
Worrying wouldn’t extend your life. That much was certainly true. And so was the exact opposite. Caleb’s worry had subtracted days, maybe even years from his life, figuratively but perhaps literally as well. 
Even before the power crash, Caleb was constantly worrying. Worrying about his students, his lesson plans, his family. Worrying about finances, how he’d pay for Yaya’s college and soon Tic’s as well. Worrying about his anxiety and what it was doing to his health … the list was never-ending. He knew the Bible told him to cast his cares on the Lord, but there was no step-by-step tutorial showing him how to actually do that. 
Even though Jesus’ sermon didn’t answer all his questions, Caleb still found comfort in the familiar words: If God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
Yes, God had kept Caleb clothed. Tonight was the first time his pants had completely thawed out. They’d gotten looser over the miles, but at least he didn’t feel like he was walking in a stiff and frozen cardboard costume. Both men had good winter coats. Griz was as uptight as a drill sergeant about changing their socks. Caleb’s feet were terribly blistered, but not frostbitten. Tonight, he could wiggle each individual toe.
Even though he didn’t have the strength of heart or emotional stamina to read Rachel’s letters, he could still feel her prayers. She wasn’t here, but she knew how to intercede for him. He thought about all the ways God had provided for their journey up to this point. How many of those blessings were a direct result of the faithful petitions of his devoted wife?
He could only let his thoughts linger on home for a short spell at a time, so he turned back to Tic’s Bible. 
A few minutes later, his reading was interrupted by a low, prolonged howl that rattled around in the emptiness of his very soul.
On their journey, Caleb had gotten used to Arsenal’s multiple ways of communicating. The dog had a special pitch and tone for when he was hungry, when he was bored, when he wanted attention, or when he demanded to be left alone. But this sound tonight was new. Pained. Soul-wrenching. How could the entire sadness of the human experience exist in a canine’s cry?
In spite of all the admonitions Caleb had just read not to be anxious, his mind immediately flashed to an image of Griz lying dead in the hallway, his poor dog wailing over him. He sprang up, racing toward the pitiable noise, terrified of what he might find.
But Griz wasn’t dead in the hallway. He was on the floor in front of the memorial to the two dead Marines. 
While Arsenal sat by his side and lifted up tortured and mournful howls, Griz was collapsed on the ground, his entire body heaving with silent sobs.
 


28. THE TRIUMPHAL ENTRY

“Look at that boy go!”
“Back up. Everyone just step back and give him some space.”
Tic was self-conscious from this unnecessary degree of attention, but also proud as he swung forward on the crutches Miss Cecelia had brought him home from the clinic.
“You need a break?” Mom asked, but he shook his head resolutely.
“That kid’s gonna be sprinting around the whole town by the time the snow melts,” Dev declared.
Mrs. Singh clasped her hands together. “Praise the Lord. He really is the God who heals.”
It wasn’t running suicide drills on the basketball court. It wasn’t a 5k cross-country race. But it was worlds better than sitting on the couch day after day. Good-bye, chamber pot.
Benji’s grin was sincere, without a hint of irony. Even AJ looked ecstatic to see him up and about. Tic did one more round, circling the dining room table on his crutches as Priyah snapped the shutter of an old-fashioned camera she’d found in the garage.
When he finished his final lap, Mom gave him a hug. Dev insisted on shaking his hand. Even Miss Cecelia gave him a stoic nod of approval.
The moment would have been perfect.
If only Dad were here.

***

Dreaming again. She and her son, on the path to their favorite berry patch. Her little boy, happy and carefree and oblivious, scampering down the trail, spurred on by the promise of a delicious snack, the delights of a beautiful summer day. Running up ahead, confident that he was safe under Mom’s attentive gaze.
And then the smell … Her senses were instantly on alert.
A moment later she saw it. That two-legged beast directly between her and her baby …
There wasn’t time to warn him. There was only time to surge forward, to protect her child. Charging at full speed. Racing ahead as an otherworldly roar welled up from the core of her being.
The same dream. The same path. The same fear. 
Except this time, Rachel was the bear. Running. Galloping. Roaring. Slashing and wounding and maiming anything and everything that posed a danger to her son.
It didn’t matter what became of her. It didn’t matter if the fight cost her life.
She was fighting for her child’s life, and nothing in heaven or on earth or in hell below would compel her to stop.

***

“You sure you want to keep building on Indonesia and New Guinea?” Dev asked.
AJ let out a little chuckle and blushed. “I don’t know. It would be pretty easy for someone to take over Australia if I didn’t.”
“That’s stupid,” her little brother insisted. “Australia’s never been the center of any world conflict. It’s not important enough to worry about.”
“But I like having the whole continent,” AJ said.
“Leave her alone,” Benji told Junior. “Not everyone’s a history nerd like you. Some people just like to play a simple board game.”
“There’s nothing simple about Risk,” Junior answered defensively. Beside him, Dev nodded in agreement.
Tic glanced up and offered AJ a weary smile. She had spent her first week here completely ignoring him, but recently they had settled into a casual understanding. She obviously didn’t have real feelings for him anymore (if she ever had). And who could blame her, given that Tic couldn’t even walk without assistance, and even then only a few feet at a time? But at least she didn’t treat him with open disdain.
If Tic had to choose between AJ hating him or relegating him to the friend zone, he knew exactly which option he would prefer.
“Leo, you get back in here!” Miss Cecelia yelled. She bustled into the living room after Leo and Cammy, who both scampered under the card table on all fours. Leo let out an exuberant laugh, while Cammy — fully healed now from her shoulder injury — yipped just as enthusiastically, as if they were playing a game of tag and Miss Cecelia was It. 
“Stop that child before he gets near the stove,” Miss Cecelia ordered, but AJ had already swept Leo up and set him onto her lap.
“Look at him,” she gushed. “Can you believe how fast he’s —”
Her sentiment was interrupted by shouts of “Leo, no!” and “AJ, watch out!”
A second later, colorful armies of infantry, cavalry, and artillery flew off the game board, which Leo had obliterated with all the force and destruction of a giggling, oblivious atomic bomb.

“Okay,” Boone said, his blue eyes twinkling. “You’re up first. You ready?”
Yaya laughed, surprised as always at how many games they could invent to pass the time with no cell phones or electronics. If it weren’t for Boone, she would have given in to the hunger and despair long ago. But she was holding on because he was beside her, that steadying force she never realized she needed.
“I’m ready,” she told him. “Just go easy on me.”
His dimple flashed, and he flipped over the sand timer they’d scoured from a geologist’s desk. “All right, first question. Tell me about the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you in elementary school.”
That was easy. Yaya cozied into the corner of the sectional and smiled at the memory. “Okay, it was fourth grade. We were having spirit week and it happened to be pajama day, so I was wearing these Pokemon pajama pants, and for PE we were playing basketball in the gym. I was a pretty good blocker, but I couldn’t shoot worth anything. So I got the ball on a rebound, started to take it down the court. My friend’s trying to steal it from me, and she reaches out, and at the same time I start to trip and she reaches out to help, but she ends up grabbing my pants and pulling them down in front of everybody. Worst thing was my mom hadn’t done laundry in a while so I was wearing this really old, super babyish pair of unicorn and rainbow underwear, and I was totally mortified.”
Boone’s laugh was easy and casual, and any teasing or jokes about her underwear never came. “Oh, that’s brutal.” He glanced at the sand timer, which was now half empty. “All right. Here’s a harder one. Do you believe in God?”
Yaya stared at the grains of sand in the timer, willing them to drain faster. “Well …”
Boone’s smile faded. “I know we said no passing, but I can come up with another question if you’d prefer.”
She shook her head. “That’s okay. I’m not stalling because I don’t want to answer. I honestly don’t know.”
He reached his arm around the back of the sectional. The gesture, the soft touch, it all felt so natural. Like they’d been sitting this way for months. Maybe years.
She bit her lip and stared at the timer. She couldn’t concentrate on her answer when she was so aware of his gaze, his closeness. Then slowly, one word at a time, she felt Boone gently pull the truth from her soul. 
“I don’t think it’s that I ever stopped fully believing in God,” she began. “It’s more like I saw my parents when I was growing up, and they were so into church and religion and prayer and stuff, and I guess in my head I thought to myself that’s the kind of thing that adults do. Right? Adults have jobs and pay taxes and worship Jesus. So when I was little, I assumed that Christianity would somehow just click once I got older. But then it never did. I remember waking up one day, I must have been in tenth grade or something. And I told my dad what I’d been thinking. I said, ‘If you and Mom were Muslims, I’d believe the Koran was true. If you were LDS, I’d believe the Book of Mormon was true. If you were atheists, I’d believe that was true.’ And I guess I was hoping he could say something to make it all make sense, you know, like wave a magic wand and take all my doubts away. But all he said was, ‘Well, the difference is that the Koran and the Book of Mormon aren’t the inspired Word of God.’ And he said it with such finality, you know? Like he honestly thought it was going to be this big mic-drop moment or something. And I remember thinking, if my own dad can’t explain to me why I’m supposed to believe the Bible’s real but all these other religions aren’t, then nobody really can be all that certain of anything, can they?”
Boone stared at her, but she couldn’t quite read his expression. “You were having these thoughts in tenth grade?” he asked, his blue eyes wide.
“It’s not that weird, is it?” Suddenly, she felt self-conscious. Maybe this game wasn’t going to be nearly as fun as she imagined. She reached out and picked up the timer, which had long ago run out of sand. “Anyway. Now it’s your turn.”
“Wait.” He put his hand over hers, his entire palm covering her entire hand. And those intense blue eyes … 
She tried to laugh him off. “Time’s up,” she reminded him. “Those were the rules.”
“Wait.” Now both of her hands were surrounded by both of his. What was happening? “I want to tell you something.”
“What is it?” she asked, but her voice was so quiet she couldn’t even hear herself. Couldn’t even be sure her lips had actually moved.
He never blinked, and she couldn’t pry her eyes away from his. He gave her hands a squeeze. “I’m sorry.”
“For what?” she asked, still trying to sound light-hearted, still trying to pretend that they were just two people playing a silly game to pass the time while the world imploded around them.
“I’m sorry you didn’t have anyone to talk to back then. It sounds …” Here his eyes flitted away from hers, but only for a second. “It sounds lonely,” he finally answered. 
In his gaze, Yaya saw the echoes of unnamed fears, the mirror of nagging doubts, the dream of a universe that might one day reveal its mysteries to them both.

***

“Hey, Mom, will you help me for a minute?” Tic called out.
Rachel was scrubbing laundry in the kitchen sink, but her back and neck were tight from staying in one position, and she was thankful for an excuse to take a break. 
She frowned when she saw Tic on the living room floor struggling with a pair of snow pants. “What do you think you’re doing with those?”
“Getting ready to go outside,” he answered with a grin.
“No, you’re not. Your crutches will sink through the snow.”
“I don’t need my crutches,” Tic argued.
She stared at him incredulously, her hands on her hips. “Then how exactly do you plan to get around? You know what Miss Cecelia said. At least two more weeks before you put any weight on that leg.”
“Benji and Junior are gonna take me cross-country skiing. Dev’s helping them make a seat on the sled right now.”
So now Dev was in on their plan? This was news to her.
“There’s ice under all that snow,” she argued. “You’re gonna get bumped and jostled and hurt your leg again.”
“I won’t hurt my leg again. They’re gonna go slow.” He straightened his expression and stared straight at her. “Mom, it’s like twenty-five degrees. The sun’s out. Don’t you think some fresh air would be good for me?”
Just then, the front door burst open. “You ready, Tic?” Junior yelled excitedly.
“I’m getting my snow pants on,” Tic called back, then looked up at his mom with pleading eyes. 
Rachel knew how to admit defeat. She knelt down and helped Tic with his winter gear.

***

With the treacherous mountain now completely behind him, Caleb looked out across the picturesque view. The landscape was still covered with snow, but brave splotches here and there popped up to reveal mud and dried out grass. In another month, the entire valley would be green and fertile, stretching out endlessly in all directions, as beautiful and peaceful as the Shire.
He paused on the path and smiled to himself. Arsenal stopped pulling his sled. Griz looked behind him with a question in his eye.
“If I take one more step,” Caleb declared, “it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.” He laughed, but Griz’s expression didn’t change.
“Fellowship of the Ring,” Caleb explained, then when Griz still looked puzzled added, “Lord of the Rings.”
Griz shook his head and turned back around. 
“They did a lot of walking in that one,” Caleb muttered then hurried to keep up with his friend. Now that the terrain was flat, Griz was pushing their pace. Caleb struggled more than he wanted to admit to keep up, but it was always rewarding to see each new mile marker bearing witness to their forward progress. They were on track to arrive in Delta in just a few days. 
Griz had fashioned himself a walking stick that reminded Caleb of Gandalf’s staff. In fact, he was seeing Tolkien symbols everywhere, like when Griz caught two hares for dinner that night. 
“Too bad we don’t have any taters,” Caleb lamented, but Griz remained unfazed. 
Then and there, Caleb made it his mission to tell Griz the entire story of the Lord of the Rings, from Bilbo’s birthday celebration to the fires of Mount Doom and everything in between. He was more familiar now with the films than the books and did his best to remember every minute detail, every quote-worthy line. At the rate he was going, the Fellowship would reach Rivendell around the same time Caleb and Griz stumbled into Fairbanks.
“So they’re trying to cross the bridge,” Caleb explained a few days into the retelling. More so now than with any other scene, he wished he had a high-definition TV and full stereo surround-sound system to give Griz the full effect. “And they’re jumping one after another, Legolas and Gimli and Aragorn, and they’re tossing the hobbits across, and right when they think they’re all safe, this big fiery whip comes out and snap! The Balrog grabs Gandalf and is about to pull him down into the abyss. And Gandalf is holding onto the ledge, but he knows he won’t be able to hold on for long, so he looks at the other members of the Fellowship and he says, ‘Fly, you fools.’” Caleb tried his best to impersonate Ian McKellen’s low, raspy voice.
“That’s enough movie quotes for today,” Griz snapped. 
Arsenal gave Caleb a nudge on his thigh until he pet the scruff of his neck, and they kept walking.
And walking.
And walking.

***

“Come on, it’s cold back here,” Yaya complained. “What is it you wanted to show me?” Tired and even more hungry than usual, she felt like she and Boone had been walking for miles even though they never left the GI building.
Boone held her hand, a gesture that felt both completely natural and exhilarating at the same time, and he tugged her forward. “Here we are.”
She looked around, trying to get her bearings. “What are we doing outside the high-bay lab?”
“Wrong question,” Boone answered, his dimple pronounced as he grinned her way. “You should be asking what we’ll be doing inside the high-bay lab.”
He fumbled with his ring of janitorial keys, trying to find the right fit. His entire aura seemed to be buzzing. “You’re gonna love this.”
In spite of her hunger-induced fatigue, Yaya’s body experienced a jolt of anticipation and excitement. Everybody else in the lab was lying around, waiting for the military to show up with aid and rations. The moment rumors started circulating that the Alaska military was regrouping, everyone else seemed to stop thinking and acting for themselves and just rolled over, half comatose, waiting for help to arrive.
But she and Boone were different.
He finally found the right key and swung open the high bay door with a flourish. He gestured for her to look in then stood to the side, beaming.
She blinked, certain she was missing the punchline to some great joke.
Boone shuffled his weight awkwardly. “You recognize this?”
She tilted her head as if looking from a different angle might change what she was seeing. 
“An old, rusty school bus?” 
The lower half was painted green, several window panes were missing, and it looked like there were holes in the exterior, whether from bullets or exposure. It certainly wouldn’t have made the list of the top thousand things she would have guessed Boone wanted to show her.
“Don’t you know what this is?” Boone asked, his enthusiasm beginning to wane.
“It’s a bus,” she answered, unimpressed. 
Boone shook his head, seemed to regroup, and pulled her into the high bay. “Into the Wild. Bus 142. You’ve seriously never heard of it?”
“Never.”
“There’s only a handful of people who even know it’s here. They had to transport it by helicopter, and it had to be super hush-hush. It’s only the most famous bus in the entire country.”
“You’re forgetting the Magic School Bus,” Yaya joked, still completely clueless what the big deal was about this hunk of rusting metal.
“Did your parents raise you in some kind of bubble?” he asked, and Yaya didn’t want to admit the way that his words stung or how close to the truth they actually rang. 
“Into the Wild,” he repeated again, as if the words would mean more to her the second time hearing them. “Didn’t you see any movies growing up?”
“My dad watches the entire Lord of the Rings every Christmas break, and my mom can quote Princess Bride by heart.” Just talking about her family back home brought an unexpected lump to Yaya’s throat.
Boone shook his head then straightened his spine and adopted his professorial tone. “Well then, I see we have a lot of learning ahead of us. Come on. It’s not even locked. Let’s look around inside.”
For the next several hours, Yaya was once more Boone’s student. He told her about Christopher McCandless, an upper-class honors student who gave up his college fund and started roaming the country, eventually living off the land near Healy, Alaska in this very vehicle. Yaya became entranced by Boone’s storytelling, so that by the time she realized she was sitting a couple feet away from where this poor vagabond actually died, it didn’t feel eerie.
“After the book came out about his life,” Boone went on, “hikers from all over started looking for the bus. A lot of them got hurt or lost, and finally the park decided it was too dangerous to keep it where it was. It was such a big deal they had to move the bus in secret. They’re going to restore it and put it in the campus museum.”
Yaya stared at the empty hull, wondering if she was still missing something. “So, big-city boy comes to Alaska, finds an abandoned bus, lives in it for a few months, dies from eating poisoned berries, and that somehow inspires thousands of people to venture out into the wilderness? All that to see a bus?”
“It’s not the bus,” Boone answered earnestly, his intense blue eyes boring straight into hers. “It’s everything the bus represents. The idea of shedding the entrapments of society … not to mention the weight of parental expectations.”
He stared unblinking until she had to glance down. Her hands were in her lap, and now his were holding onto hers. He gave her palm a squeeze. “This is a place where you can shake off your old worldview, your old pretenses, your own perception of self. Right here in this bus, you can become whoever it is you were truly meant to be.”
Yaya gave a tired chuckle. “You sound like a speaker at the youth group conferences I used to go to.”
Without warning, Boone reached out and stroked her cheek. It was soft. Gentle. Warming. His face dropped closer to hers. “There’s so much more to this life than your silly little church conferences could have ever prepared you for,” he whispered. 
His breath was hot on her neck, but a cold chill ran down her spine.

***

Palm Sunday had long been Rachel’s favorite holiday. From waving palm branches at her parents’ church as a little girl to singing and dancing to the Hosanna song with her children when they were little, she had always loved the pure joy and innocence of the celebration. Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem might not have been as well known as his birth or his resurrection, but the Palm Sunday holiday was free from any outside commercialization or secularization, and for that Rachel adored it even more.
That’s why she was thankful Dev had gone all out in helping the children put together a Palm Sunday pageant to start off Holy Week. When she wasn’t at the food bank with Cecelia, Rachel was too tired to do much other than worry. She’d given most of the cooking and cleaning jobs over to Angel, and the care of baby Leo was a responsibility everyone in the house shared. Which meant that over the past week, Rachel had been spending more time in bed than was probably wise. 
Sleeping so much was never a harbinger of good news, but what else could she do?
Today, though, she had made an effort. She’d brushed her hair, washed her face, and put on a pink blouse with an elephant pattern she loved. It was something she might have worn to church back in that period in history when people drove themselves places and turned the lights on in their homes and weren’t completely paralyzed by incessant worry about their missing husband and daughter.
Priyah had snapped a photograph of everybody before the pageant. She was nearly out of film, and Rachel had no idea if they would ever find a way to get it developed, but smiling for a camera with a house full of friends reminded her of her childhood, of family meals and holiday gatherings and simpler, joyful times.
A melancholy warmth filled Rachel’s heart as she watched Junior, who stood in front of the wood stove with Dev’s heavy annotated Bible in his hands. Out of all the children in her home, AJ’s little brother seemed to be thriving the most under Dev’s spiritual tutelage. Earlier in the week, he’d made a public confession of his saving faith in Christ, and as soon as Moose Creek thawed in the spring, Dev was going to baptize him. The young boy’s budding faith made today’s celebration even more meaningful.
“When they drew near to Jerusalem,” Junior read, his voice squeaking slightly, “Jesus sent two disciples.”
Tic and Benji emerged from behind the tablecloth they’d stapled to the ceiling as a makeshift stage curtain. The teens had outgrown their church’s Easter and Christmas pageants years ago, but nobody complained or seemed self-conscious about their roles in this year’s performance.
Junior pointed his finger melodramatically and continued reading from Dev’s Bible. “‘Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me.’” 
Everybody knew what part of the skit was coming up next, and adults and kids alike tried unsuccessfully to stifle their giggles.
“The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them,” Junior continued, a mischievous grin spreading over his face as he peeked behind the curtain. He gestured, waited, and was met with stifled laughs.
“We’re ready,” AJ finally whispered, then emerged on all fours, her cheeks beet red but her smile radiant.
Her brother read his next line with the fervor of a sports announcer. “They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.”
Next to emerge from behind the curtain was Priyah. She was carrying baby Leo, whom she gently placed on AJ’s back. Priyah held him steady to keep him from falling off and recited her lines in hardly more than a whisper: “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”
Benji and Tic, the hype men of the chorus, raised their hands to indicate that the adults should join in.
“Hosanna!” Rachel let her voice lift to heaven, swelling up in her soul past the laughter, past the happiness, past the ache in her heart that commingled with so much joy. “Hosanna to the Son of David.”
Leo, sensing the commotion was all for his benefit, kicked his feet excitedly and pounded his little fists.
“Oof, my hair!” AJ exclaimed as he yanked a fistful of her long locks. Priyah tried to disentangle the mess, and her mom rushed to her side to help.
A moment later, AJ was collapsed on the floor, her scalp and beautiful black tresses no worse off for their suffering. She shrieked playfully as Leo leaned down and gave her shoulder an open-mouthed kiss. Priyah had forgotten her self-consciousness and was laughing nearly as loudly as AJ.
With the grace and agility of an athletic teen boy with a gimpy leg, Tic plopped onto the floor beside his friends. He took Leo’s hands in his. “Hosanna!” Tic said in a high-pitched voice and raised Leo’s tiny arms up to the sky. 
“Hosanna!” they all repeated, and Leo kicked his legs and gurgled enthusiastically.
 


29. DARKEST NIGHT

Exhaustion had crept back in with a forceful vengeance, and there was nothing Rachel could do to ward it off. If not for the fact that Miss Cecelia needed her at the food bank today, Rachel could have spent the entire afternoon in bed. Maybe the entire week.
The AR-15 strapped to her back might as well have weighed a hundred pounds. The melting snow in the parking lot only reminded her of the relentless passing of time. Time that would stop for nothing. The bulletin board outside the community hall was a bleak testament to the disaster they were all living through. Its desperate messages flapped in the chilly breeze.
Miles, Julie and I have gone to stay with Mary in Gulkana. You can find us there. Jess
Needed: Toyo stove repair. URGENT. Will trade smoked salmon or ammunition (or make me an offer). Bruce (red home behind Trading Post)
Has anyone seen Landon Brown? He was up on North Slope. Grandma Virginia
Lost dog. Brown and gray husky. Red collar. Notify the Stricklands at mile 179. Aggressive. DO NOT CHASE.
Need firewood and food. Wheelchair-bound elder caring for four children. Contact Mike on Old School Road, third trailer on left
Each message was a story, each name a face Rachel knew. The devastation this tragedy had brought to their community was more than her soul could bear. There was no way to lift all these burdens up to the Lord. Her prayer list had dwindled down to Tic and Caleb and Yaya, and some days even that was shortened to one single, pathetic word: Help.
A few minutes after she opened up the food bank, the bell tinkled and Pastor Tom walked in, stomping slush off his boots.
“We haven’t had time to grab everything out from the back yet,” she told him. “Give me another minute or two to get myself organized.”
“I’m not here for food,” Pastor Tom told her, and for the first time she noticed the sorrow in his eyes. 
“Is Miss Cecelia with you?” he asked. “I’ve got some hard news I need to share with you both.”

***

“So these are the songs Dev told us to pick from for Good Friday.” Tic slid the open hymnal over for AJ to look at.
She flipped through the titles and let out a little giggle. “I don't think I know any of these,” she admitted.
“It's not that big of a deal,” he replied with a shrug. “Honestly, I probably don’t even know half of them.” He flipped through the pages until something caught his eye. “Let’s start with this one. I know my mom likes it.”
“O Sacred Head, Now Wounded?” AJ read out loud with a lilt in her voice.
When he volunteered to create the worship song list for their Good Friday service, Tic had no idea the task would be so involved or so time intensive. But Dev wanted to make sure every song was specifically about the crucifixion. 
As it turned out, Tic knew five times as many songs about Jesus’ resurrection as he did about his death. At least it gave him and AJ the chance to focus on a tangible goal instead of awkwardly ignoring how uncomfortable everything had grown between them.
Tic missed the days when he and AJ would just sit together in science class, doodling or laughing or poking fun at the long, boring videos Mrs. Bell always put on when she didn’t want to actually stand in front of the class and teach. He missed the days when he could send AJ into a fit of laughter with just a look, when a shared glance between them seemed to communicate more than a thousand soliloquies.
He missed his life before the crash. But he couldn’t talk to AJ about that. He could hardly talk to her about anything anymore.
AJ was running her finger beneath the hymnal’s lyrics. “With grief and shame laid down?” 
Tic recognized the confusion on her face. “Yeah, these are all pretty old.” He read the lyrics again. “I think it’s talking about how when Jesus was on the cross, he was, like … full of grief and shame?” He was glad Dev wasn’t here to listen to him stumbling.
“Now scornfully surrounded,” AJ continued, “with thorns thine only crown.” She glanced up at him, as if waiting for an explanation.
“Uh, see, when Jesus was on the cross getting crucified, they had put … There was this crown, and they made it out of these thorns, you know, and …” Tic hated the way he was tripping over his words. A couple days ago, Dev had pulled him aside and explained that by working on the song list with AJ, it was a great opportunity to teach her more about Christ. By the time they finished selecting songs for the Good Friday service, AJ would probably believe in UFOs and space aliens more than God.
“Why do they have to make it all so confusing?” she asked, and Tic could see her point. Having been raised in the church, he’d gotten so used to these old, archaic phrases that he rarely stopped to wonder what they might mean.
“I don’t know,” he admitted and adjusted his position in his seat.
“Your leg okay?” AJ asked.
“Yeah,” Tic answered, wondering how he could find a way to get the conversation back to Jesus on the cross. He wanted to tell AJ more about his faith. She had Dad’s Charles Spurgeon devotional now, but when she said she didn’t understand it and Tic offered to read some of it with her, he was just as lost as she was. Everything was so flowery and poetic, and you basically had to have a Bible degree and be fluent in old-timey English to get much out of it. 
The front door opened, and Mom walked in followed by Miss Cecelia. Tic still couldn’t get used to seeing his mother coming and going to the food bank with Dad’s old AR-15 strapped to her back. He knew it was necessary, but he didn’t like it. If he weren’t a cripple barely able to get by on his crutches, he’d be the one walking around town armed, not her.
Each time she came home from the community hall, her face looked older and sadder. He’d heard her whispering with Miss Cecelia. The food bank was nearly out of supplies. The convenience store had emptied its shelves within the first 24 hours of the crash, and Glennallen’s only restaurant had been broken into and looted by the end of the first week. 
What would happen when the entire town ran out of food?
AJ was looking up from the hymnal, her face a mirror of worry and anxiety. Something was wrong.
“What is it?” Tic asked. “Why do you look like that?”
If something had happened to Mom, if someone had threatened or hurt her or scared her while he was here convalescing like a useless invalid, he’d never forgive himself.
Mom shut her eyes for a moment and drew in a deep breath. “Is Dev here?” she asked.
“He’s out with the rest of them checking on the snares.” Tic leveled his gaze. “Mom, what’s going on? What is it?”
She sank down into a chair, slumping down as if she’d been wearing a hundred-pound weighted vest. “It’s Mrs. Bell,” she said and shook her head sadly. “I just heard today that she passed away. Pastor Tom came and told me. They think it was the flu.”
AJ and Tic stared at each other in disbelief.
“Mrs. Bell?” Tic repeated, testing the words. How did that even make sense?
He knew AJ was looking at him and didn’t know what to do with his face. Was he expected to cry? It wasn’t like Mrs. Bell was his grandma or anything. She was just the woman who taught him science. And coached his co-ed basketball team in middle school. And led the summer reading program at the library every year. 
“Are you both okay?” Mom asked, and it was the weirdest question. Because Tic didn’t feel any different than he had two minutes ago. A little confused, maybe, but not heartbroken or devastated or even actually sad. It was like hearing on the news about a hiker who died climbing Denali. Something removed, just one of those things that happen.
But to Mrs. Bell? His teacher?
“I’m fine,” Tic answered and reached out to grab his crutches before he knew where he was going.
“What are you doing?” Mom asked.
“I gotta use the outhouse,” Tic decided and swung himself out the front door.

***

Rachel watched Tic leave and resisted the urge to run after him. For a moment, the dining room was filled with the awkwardest of silences, broken only by Miss Cecelia’s raspy cough.
AJ glanced up from the hymnal she was staring at, looking lost and broken and terrified. Rachel tried to think of something, anything, to say to try to comfort her. “You doing okay?” was the best she could manage.
AJ nodded slowly. “Yeah. Um, I think that … uh, yeah. I’m okay.”
Rachel decided not to press her. “What are you and Tic working on?”
AJ appeared relieved to change the subject. “Songs for Friday.” She thumbed through the worn hymnal. “There’s a lot of them in here,” she added with a shy laugh.
Rachel smiled. “Hey, do you know where Angel is?” It was rare to come home from the community hall and not see Angel in the kitchen.
“Down in the basement, I think.” 
Rachel headed downstairs. Back was that feeling of walking through mud, the idea that every inch she moved drained a mile’s worth of energy. But even heavier now.
Ever since the grid crashed, she’d done her best. She’d stayed busy. Kept herself focused on the Lord and all his blessings and gifts. When Tic was bedridden, she had a reason to get herself out of bed, an excuse to stay engaged. But now her boy was moving around on his own, albeit on crutches. Keeping the food bank open sapped the last bit of her strength. Every time Caleb’s rifle clanged against the back of her leg was a reminder that their world had devolved into violence and scarcity.
It was too much. The message board, the empty shelves in the community hall, the cold and the dark and the uncertainty. The news of Mrs. Bell’s death.
Reminders everywhere of the life they had known. Reminders everywhere that her husband and protector was gone, that her daughter was missing and might never come home.
It was all too much.
Rachel’s only comfort was the thought that in a few more days, a week at most, the food bank would have nothing left. She wouldn’t have to strap on that dead weight and tramp through cold and slush then stand there bearing witness to the horrors members of her community were living through. She could stay home and suffer alone and in silence like everybody else, just like her brain and body craved.
After a sluggish eternity, Rachel found herself with the flashlight at the bottom of the basement stairs. “Angel?” she called out. Pastor Tom had asked her if she would help plan Mrs. Bell’s funeral, and secretly she was hoping it was a job her friend would volunteer to take on, Angel with her infinite reserves of warmth and compassion and hospitality and goodness. In spite of everything they were going through, without makeup or hot showers or a washing machine or any sense of normalcy whatsoever, Angel still emerged from her room every day looking calm and poised and radiant.
Rachel would rarely admit it even to herself, but it was enough to make her sick.
“Angel?” she called out again, then saw her friend kneeling by the open pantry door. She clutched Leo in his sling against her chest and was hunched over on the floor. 
Rachel saw the tears on Angel’s cheeks, and for a horrific moment she worried something unspeakable had happened to the baby. “What is it?” she gasped.
Angel shook her head, as if the misery she was experiencing was something impossible to voice.
Immediately forgetting every terrible thought she’d ever directed toward her friend, she dropped by Angel’s side. “What happened? What’s wrong?”
“It’s nothing,” Angel answered, swatting her tears away aggressively. “It’s stupid.”
Rachel ran her hand in soft circles across Angel’s back. “You can tell me,” she coaxed. 
Angel shook her head. “You’ll think I’m ridiculous.”
“I won’t,” Rachel promised. “What is it?”
Angel stared forlornly at the pantry door, her entire face breaking as she sobbed, “We’re out of salt.”
Any other day, any other time in history, Rachel might have laughed. Except now she knew what this all meant. They needed salt to stomach the beans that had become their primary staples, to season the hare and the trout that Dev and the kids brought in. When summer came, they’d need salt to ferment the vegetables they were hoping to grow in the garden, and in the fall to preserve the moose and caribou they would need to survive.
Leo fussed, and Rachel helped release him from Angel’s sling and stood up to bounce him on her hip.
Angel stood up too, laughing quietly at herself as she dried her eyes. “Anyway, God is good. All the time. He always provides. I’m sure we’ll manage.” She forced a smile and headed toward the stairs. Rachel followed, uncertain what she should say. What she could say.
Before they left the basement, Angel laid a hand on Rachel’s arm. “Quick favor to ask you?”
“Anything,” Rachel agreed, her mental exhaustion momentarily forgotten.
Angel let out a chuckle and glanced at her feet. “Don’t tell Dev I was crying, okay? I don’t want to turn into tonight’s object lesson in Christians being the salt of the world.”

***

Delta Junction. 10 miles.
Caleb stared at the sign and didn’t know if he wanted to start running ahead or to stop dead in his tracks and kiss the ground and praise God for bringing them this far.
For the past several days, the road had been flat and relatively easy. The temperature was cold, but the wind wasn’t biting, and the longer hours of daylight bore all the promises of spring and, with them, hope.
Do you remember spring, Mr. Frodo? The scene up on Mount Doom ran through his mind, and he tried to imagine how he’d tell Griz that part of the story when they got to it.
Ten more miles. It would be evening soon, but if everything went as planned, they would reach Buster’s cabin tomorrow. 
Caleb had heard people quote cliches like hope is the best medicine but never believed or experienced the truth of those words until now. The ache in his back was gone. Even if he wanted to, he couldn’t feel the callouses on his feet or the cold in his joints or the hunger in his gut. His pack felt light, as if it were nothing more than the book bag he carried to and from school every day, back when he was simply a middle-school teacher. 
Back when the world was normal.
Even Arsenal seemed to sense the shift and tugged at his harness as if it took all his energy to keep from darting ahead like a sled dog in the Iditarod.
Griz was the only one who grew more morose the closer they got to town. “Gonna be a lot of people up ahead,” he warned and made sure that his .45-caliber pistol was ready in his holster and the AR-15 he wore slung over his back was within easy reach. With each step, Griz’s tension increased palpably, and because he always walked a few steps ahead of Caleb, it was easy to see when he practiced the quick movements he’d need to make for a speedy draw.
But Caleb couldn’t hold those worries in his head. Not with Buster and his radio a day’s walk away. Lord willing, tomorrow he would hear his wife’s voice, or at least leave her the message that he was safe. Since their marriage, they’d never gone a single day without at least talking by phone. The day he left Glennallen, he imagined the worst aspect of the separation would be not knowing what was happening at home, not knowing if she and Tic were safe. But he realized that the physical separation, the inability to be there to protect his bride, was even worse. The entire world was in chaos right now, but that wouldn’t be nearly so daunting if they could face it side by side.
And as much as he needed to be there to watch over Rachel and keep her safe, he needed her to ground him, soothe his troubled thoughts, calm his restless heart. For as long as he could remember, his anxiety had been a dull, chronic ache so deep in the background of his life he barely noticed it. But now, with nothing but Lord of the Rings quotes and snow for miles and miles every day, the spiraling in his brain was like a whirlpool, threatening every moment to pull him under and drown him forever.
He needed his wife. Needed to talk to her. Needed to hear her voice.
The number of stalled and abandoned cars increased the closer they got to town. Thankfully, they didn’t come across any more frozen bodies. People lucky enough to get stranded out here were close enough to civilization they would have found shelter, no matter how crude. Still, the snow-covered vehicles paused forever in the middle of the highway stood like stark and eerie reminders of the way the world had changed.
In spite of these macabre specters that occasionally dotted the Richardson Highway, the sun was bright. It was the first day of the journey with temperatures above freezing, and the snow turned to mush beneath their feet. Griz had them stop and change their socks every few miles. By the time they reached the decommissioned tanks positioned outside of Fort Greeley, Caleb was sweating, and Arsenal’s tail drooped uncharacteristically as he panted and strained against his harness.
It was Griz who stopped first. Caleb thought it was another sock changeover, but he just stood, staring.
That’s when Caleb saw it. The black scorch marks on the buildings and snow below. The scattered debris blowing aimlessly in the breeze.
“What happened here?” Caleb asked, more to himself than anyone else.
“Bombed,” Griz declared.
“By who?”
“Dunno.”
Arsenal whined, and Griz stooped down to pour some water from his canteen into the collapsible bowl that clipped onto Arsenal’s harness. For a long moment that stretched out into the decimated skyline, the only sound to be heard was that of the dog’s greedy slurping.
Caleb glanced over. Did Griz have friends who worked here? Lived here?
Died here?
Griz tugged at the harness strap. “Let’s go.”
Arsenal looked up at him, drool cascading from his mouth like a spring waterfall.
“Let’s go,” he repeated, even more sternly.
Both Caleb and the dog followed.

***

Rachel had known this day would come. It was an inevitability, after all. And yet she still wasn’t prepared.
She had the feeling that she should do something, but all she had energy to do was stare at the food pantry shelves, now completely bare as the postmaster carried out the very last box, a meager offering with a bag of egg noodles, two cans of stewed tomatoes, and a pound of dried black beans. 
Miss Cecelia grabbed a hand towel and attacked a thin layer of dust on the empty shelf. “I guess that’s it,” she declared and let out a phlegmy cough.
The women hadn’t discussed what would happen next. Rachel had been too exhausted to plan that far ahead. Even now, she was thinking of bed more than the hungry residents of Glennallen.
“I better make a sign,” Miss Cecelia said and hurried to her back office. The woman might be old enough to be Rachel’s grandma but was still bustling, while Rachel trudged each day through a molasses-encrusted haze, a fog of cement that seeped into her joints and bones and soul.
Her only relief? Now that they didn’t need her anymore at the food bank, she could go home and go back to bed.
The bell tinkled, and someone came in. “Hello, Rachel.”
Her eyes took several moments to send the proper signals to her brain. Pastor Tom. She tried to smile but decided it would take too much effort.
Tom cocked his head to the side. “You okay?”
“We’re out of food,” she announced, her voice flat.
He looked around the empty room as if taking it all in for the first time. “That’s a shame.”
She stared down at his winter boots. “Yup.”
“Well, I’m not here to pick up food,” he went on. “I came to ask you about the funeral. Mr. Bell said he’s thinking of a week from Wednesday. That’ll give him the chance to spread the word. Does it give you enough time to make the preparations? He’d like to hold it here since it’s more centrally located than the church.”
“That’ll work,” Rachel told him, knowing she’d forget the moment he walked outside. She hadn’t even approached Angel yet to ask for help making arrangements. With everyone at home so busy getting ready for Holy Week, there simply wasn’t time. No, that wasn’t quite right.
With little else to occupy her attention, Rachel had the time. What she lacked was the energy. The incentive.
The ability to do anything beyond wake up each day and eventually manage to pull herself out of bed.
Tom hesitated at the door. “Should I just come to your house one of these days to get everything finalized?”
“Sure,” Rachel answered. “That works.”
Her tired brain wouldn’t even process whether or not he said good-bye or simply left. The bell on the door jingled as he walked out, its echo ringing hollowly in Rachel’s weary heart.
 


30. LAST SUPPER

AJ’s hands were shaking as she held the piece of paper. Tic felt sorry for her and was ready with a reassuring smile if she happened to glance his way.
It was the Thursday before Easter, and everyone was gathered around the dining room table for a Passover celebration. Well, everyone except for Mom, who’d gone to bed early. 
“So this is the thing I wanted to share,” AJ said. Dev had asked everyone, kids and adults alike, to bring a Bible verse or song lyric or something meaningful to read while people ate. Dev and Angel had prepared a full Seder meal, or at least the best Christian version they could come up with in a town where nobody raised or sold lambs or any of the other special Jewish ingredients. 
AJ straightened out her piece of paper. “Um, Mrs. Winters let me borrow a book by a pastor named Charles Sturgeon.”
Tic was relieved that Dev didn’t draw attention to her mispronunciation. “I’ve been reading it in the morning,” she said, “and sometimes it’s really hard to understand. So yesterday I did that thing that Mr. Dev told us about, and before I picked it up I prayed that God would help me learn something from it. And this was what it said.”
She shot Tic a quick glance, and he was ready with his encouraging grin.
AJ cleared her throat and focused on the words on the page. “And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” She licked her lips. “And what I think this means,” she said, no longer reading but still staring at the page, “is that when Jesus was praying, it was like a symbol that he was really upset, and the blood can kind of represent his sacrifice, sort of like the grape juice we’re drinking.”
It was actually well water with a few drops of blue and red food coloring, but everyone got the idea.
AJ flushed and sat down in her seat. “And that’s what I wanted to share.” She looked up at Tic, and he started to clap before he knew what he was doing. Others joined in until Leo, emboldened by the distraction, reached out to Priyah’s plate and grabbed a slice of raw onion, cut to represent the bitterness of sin and the Israelites’ slavery in Egypt.
“Don’t let him eat that!” Mrs. Singh exclaimed, and multiple hands shot out to yank it from the baby’s mouth. They were all too late. Leo scrunched up his face then smacked his lips together until Miss Cecelia used her sleeve to wipe the onion off his tongue. It was gross, but at least everyone was laughing.
Across from him at the table, AJ shot Tic a quick smile.

***

They were long overdue, but they had finally arrived.
With daylight to spare, Caleb and Griz made their way through snow and mud and muck down the long, winding road that would lead them straight to Buster’s homestead. With each cautious step, Caleb’s mind replayed the devastation they’d seen arriving in Delta. It began at the military base and only intensified the closer they got to town — looted stores, burned cars, a few snow piles with crude crosses on the side of the road, makeshift memorials to those who had already succumbed to cold or hunger or violence.
Delta had been hit harder than anywhere else they’d seen, first by the bombs at Fort Greely and then by the destructive force of a fearful mob. Every home was shuttered against the cold and darkness and danger, and there wasn’t a living soul in sight. Initially, Caleb and Griz had wondered if they should even stop at Buster’s or keep on going. His homestead would take them hours off the highway. When all was said and done, they’d give up an entire day of travel to see a man who might not welcome them.
Who might use deadly force to keep them away.
But in the end, Caleb knew what he had to do. He had to contact his wife.
When they made their initial plans, the radio operator sounded hospitable. He was understandably cautious but willing to help the travelers out, especially when they offered to trade him ammunition for a hot meal and the chance to use his radio. But Caleb’s anxiety grew and Griz’s hand inched closer to his holster as a modest cabin covered in solar panels came into view. 
“Should we call out?” Caleb asked, his mind going back to the TV series with the frontier teacher Rachel liked so much. In that era, people were so mistrustful of strangers you had to shout “Halloo the house!” before approaching someone’s property or you’d get yourself killed.
Was that what the world had devolved into?
Griz stopped a full stone’s throw away from Buster’s home. A hand on Arsenal’s back set the dog onto his haunches, and they all watched. 
And waited.
The air was as thick as the mud caked into the soles of Caleb’s boots. Then an old man in overalls stepped cautiously onto the porch, with a shotgun aimed right at them. 
A shotgun he didn’t lower when they both slowly raised their hands in the air. 
Caleb decided that he was the least intimidating of the three stragglers and spoke first. “I’m Caleb. From Glennallen. Are you Buster?”
“Yeah, that’s me.” He didn’t lower his firearm. “But how do I know you’re who you say you are?” He was talking to Caleb but had his eyes fixed on Griz and Arsenal, who was now lying on his belly in the snow.
“My wife’s Rachel. She’s been waiting for me to get here to let her know I’m okay.”
“Anybody with a radio coulda heard that,” Buster replied. 
Caleb was stuck. If Buster didn’t trust them, there really wasn’t anything he could say to change his mind. So instead he implored him as a human being. “My wife and I are sick with worry for our daughter. Her name’s Yaya. She’s up at the University of Fairbanks. She’s studying architecture and engineering there. Smartest kid you’ll ever meet. I left home in a station wagon with my friend here to pick her up, but we got stuck, had to ditch the car on the pass and have been walking ever since. I need to know about my wife. I don’t care about anything else, I just need you to tell me if Rachel’s okay.”
Buster let a tired, soft smile crack through the wrinkles on his face. “She’s still radioing in. Fact, we’re not too far from around the time she usually calls.”
He still didn’t lower his gun or invite them forward. He scrutinized them both then finally asked, “You got ID?”
Caleb nodded, and Buster stepped off the porch, his legs bowed out like a man who would be more comfortable sitting on a horse than a chair. Slowly, Caleb showed him his driver’s license and Griz did the same.
Buster let out a low whistle. “James Ridley? From the Moose Tooth Avalanche?” He shook his head and stared at Griz in disbelief. Caleb realized again just how much about his friend he’d never known, including his full name.
Buster threw his arms around Griz, who stood unmoving in the snow. “James Ridley!” Buster repeated, letting out a jubilant laugh. “Well. I’ll be. Come in. I didn’t mean to make you stand out here in the cold. Get inside. Let’s warm you both up. I was just about to put away some caribou chili. There’s plenty left over, then we’ll get you both a hot bath, a warm bed ... James Ridley,” he exclaimed again. “After all this time, who woulda thought it?”
 Caleb glanced at Griz, who didn’t seem flattered by the recognition or pleased by the effusive display of hospitality. But Caleb’s mind was on other matters. It wasn’t the hot food or the hot bath or the hot bed Buster had mentioned. It was the promise of hearing his wife’s voice again.
Inside the cabin, Buster set generous portions of chili in front of his guests and tossed Arsenal an entire smoked salmon filet. Caleb’s head was swimming as blood rushed to his brain and his gut and his extremities now that he was out of the cold.
“This here,” Buster said, placing a picture in front of Griz, “that’s my boy. You recognize him?”
Griz barely lifted his gaze. “I recognize him.”
Buster turned to Caleb. “Your friend here? This traveling buddy of yours? He’s the one who saved my boy all those years ago up on Moose’s Tooth. Real, genuine American hero he is.” Buster got up and pulled a school photo off his fridge of a smiling boy with a missing front tooth. “This here? This is little Jake, my only grandbaby. He’s only alive ’cause of what you did that day.” Buster cleared his throat then tenderly put the photo back in place with a magnet. 
“You know, I looked for you. Wanted to find you to thank you in person for saving my boy. You been hiding out there in Glennallen all these years?”
“Something like that,” Griz mumbled. 
Sensing Griz’s discomfort, Caleb tried to change the subject. Honestly, he was just as curious as Buster was, but he had grown to respect his friend’s deep need for privacy, whatever the reasons might be.
“How old’s your grandson?” Caleb asked.
Buster stared at the old fridge, a huge faded yellow thing that looked like it could have been older than Caleb. “He’s seven. Or maybe eight now. I forget. He’s in San Francisco.” Buster’s eyes clouded over. “God help him, I haven’t heard from my boy since all this happened. That’s why I’m more than willing to help you reach Fairbanks, help you get to your daughter.”
“And Rachel …?” Caleb prodded. 
“Like I told you, she calls here every night.” A tender smile spread across Buster’s wrinkled face. “She loves you very much, that little wife of yours.”
“Is she okay? Are she and Tic safe?”
Buster shrugged. “Far as I know. She don’t talk much. Just wants to know if I’ve heard from you. Breaks my heart every single day when I have to tell her no.”
“We’ve had a rough journey,” Caleb admitted.
“Sounds like it.” Buster shook his head. “Tell you what, you two finish up here. I’ve got my radio set up in the back. You take your time, eat as much as you want, get yourselves warm and comfortable. I’ll be listening in and holler for you when she calls.”
The smoky spice from the caribou chili, the kindness of this stranger, the cozy heat emanating from Buster’s two wood stoves … none of these compared to the promise of hearing Rachel’s voice again, the sweetest blessing in all the world.

***

Tired. Hour after hour, minute after minute, Rachel was just so tired. 
Earlier that evening, Angel had knocked on her door, asking if she was going to join them for their Seder dinner.
No. Rachel wasn’t hungry. Especially not for a smorgasbord of random foods that didn’t constitute an actual meal and weren’t even made with any of the traditional Jewish Passover ingredients. Lamb had been replaced with wild hare, the charoset with chopped up raisins mixed with peanut butter, so basically ants on a log without the celery. The only slightly authentic part of their dinner was the unleavened bread, made of course without any yeast or any salt.
Next to bother her was Priyah. “Mrs. Winters?” Her voice was so soft, so demure. Sometimes Rachel wanted to grab the girl by both shoulders and shake her. You’re a human being, not a ragdoll. Talk like you have a spine!
But instead Rachel just peered out from her pile of blankets that did nothing to keep the terrible chill out of her soul.
“My dad wants to know if you’re coming down for the evening devotions or if we should start without you.” Her eyes never left the floor, and Rachel was disgusted by the child’s obvious discomfort. Was little Miss Prim and Proper embarrassed to see an adult woman in this condition?
“I still have a headache,” she told Priyah. “You guys can go on and start without me.”
Before leaving her in peace, Priyah turned around to ask, “Want me to leave the door open so you can listen in?”
“Sure,” Rachel replied. She’d get up and slam it shut the moment she found the strength, but at least for now she could let Priyah pretend she was doing her some kind of favor.
Unfortunately, the burst of energy required to get out of bed and walk the ten steps to the door never arrived, and Rachel gritted her teeth through out-of-tune singing and then Dev’s teaching voice rising and falling in pitch from downstairs. The sound was just far enough away she couldn’t make out the words, but she couldn’t ignore it either. The mental effort necessary to even exist in the same space as the dull, indecipherable noise was tortuous. 
When a hush fell over the house, she guessed they were closing their evening in prayer. Probably praying for her and her so-called “headache.” Let them. If God wanted to come down and heal her, he would. And if not, it wasn’t her fault that she was bedridden. She’d spent so long focusing on Tic and his recovery, sacrificed so many nights of sleep to hold silent, prayerful vigils. Wasting her days trudging to the food bank. Worrying incessantly for her family. It was too much for her mind to endure, so now that her son and the food bank didn’t need her every second of every day, her body had shut down.
Nobody could blame her for that, could they?
The familiar sounds of people going their separate ways. Good. Once they were all in bed, they’d leave Rachel completely alone. 
But then another set of footsteps coming up the stairs, firm and deliberate. Footsteps Rachel recognized. She wanted to groan but couldn’t muster the strength. 
“Rachel Winters?” Miss Cecelia snapped. “What do you think you’re doing still lying around in this bed?” The old woman stood with her hands on her hips, glaring angrily.
“I have a headache,” Rachel mumbled.
“No, you don’t.” Miss Cecelia grabbed the pile of blankets and tried to tug them off her. “You’re depressed because you haven’t heard from your husband, you’re worried about your daughter, you’re exhausted from caring for your son and everyone else, and you’ve given up hope.”
Rachel made a grab for the comforter, and the women engaged in a physical struggle that to Rachel’s addled brain felt like it was happening in slow motion.
“Your mother and father would be rolling over in their graves if they saw you so despondent.”
“I’m not despondent,” she grumbled, flopping her head back on her pillow once she’d gained the upper hand in their weird tug-of-war. “I’m tired.”
“Of course you are,” Miss Cecelia said. “You’ve been worrying yourself sick over your son. I know how upset it made you, how much sleep you lost for that boy. But you did what you had to do because you’re a mother, and that’s what mothers do. Now Tychicus is getting better. He doesn’t need you doting on him every moment of every day, so you turned your energy over to the food bank and now that’s closed, so you’ve decided it’s time to go ahead and start wallowing in despair, and I won’t let you. How long has it been since you ran out of your Prozac?”
Rachel stared. It was none of Miss Cecelia’s business what medication she was or wasn’t taking.
“Don’t give me that look,” Cecelia snorted. “I worked at that clinic for thirty years. I know what you take. So, are you out of your pills? Is that what’s causing this?” She gestured around the room, as if everything her eyes touched could be explained by the absence of a small white 40-mg capsule.
“When did you run out?” she demanded.
Rachel sighed. “A few days before Palm Sunday.”
Cecelia nodded as if she were a detective making a positive ID. “You been dizzy? Nauseous?”
“A little,” Rachel admitted.
“It’s the withdrawal. You should have told me. You can’t quit Prozac cold turkey.”
Rachel didn’t respond. It wasn’t as if there was a little sticker on her pill bottle that told her what to do when the world completely shut down.
Miss Cecelia sighed and softened her gaze. “It’s a hard thing, Rachel. I won’t pretend like it’s not. You’ll need a little time for your system to rework itself, and then you’ll start to feel more like you again. Remember, women’ve been caring for their families for centuries, both in sickness and in health. That’s just what mothers do.”
Rachel needed to shut her eyes, but there was no way to tell this nosy busybody to go away.
“For now,” Miss Cecelia concluded, “let me tell you what’s gonna happen. You’re gonna get out of this bed and change out of those old clothes. Angel and Priyah did the wash just a few days ago, so I know you’ve got something clean to put on. Then you’re gonna brush your teeth and your hair. You’re a mess.”
Rachel nodded like a schoolgirl who’d just been scolded. She was embarrassed, ashamed of herself, and mad at Miss Cecelia for calling her out. But that primal fear of getting in trouble did something inside her that no amount of praying or wishful thinking could have.
It got her out of bed.
By the time Rachel was dressed and had washed her face and brushed her teeth, she did feel surprisingly better. Miss Cecelia returned, still pouting, and gave her a solid nod of approval. “Now, you ready for bed?”
Rachel shook her head. “I think I’ll at least go downstairs and say goodnight to Tic.” She stopped at the door and faced her friend. “Thank you, Cecelia.”
Miss Cecelia harrumphed and left the room.
At the bottom of the staircase, Rachel paused and stared at her son, nearly gasping when she realized how much older he looked. What happened to her little boy?
Tic glanced up from his sketch pad, and Cammy wagged her stump at Rachel’s approach.
“Hey, Mom.” He offered her a small smile, and she recognized the questions that hid behind his gaze: Is this woman my mom or the empty shell she’s become?
She forced herself to look at him. Really look at him. “Hey, buddy.”
His tentative smile became more solid, more convincing.
She sat down next to him on the couch. “How was the Seder?” 
He shrugged. “Kinda interesting, I guess. It didn’t really feel like a meal, though.”
“You still hungry?” she asked. She didn’t like the way his cheeks had sunken in lately.
“Nah.”
Rachel glanced down at his drawing pad. “What are you working on?”
He looked away but didn’t close his book. It was a pencil sketch of Cammy, a huge smile on her face, her ears perked up like she was ready to play. 
“She looks like she’s waiting for you to throw her ball,” Rachel remarked, only realizing her mistake when Cammy jumped off the couch at the sound of her favorite word and grabbed a tennis ball that had rolled under the TV stand.
Tic gave it a half-hearted toss, and Cammy’s nails clicked and clacked on the floor while she tried to find the leverage she needed to chase after it.
Rachel let out her breath and tried to remember if she’d been downstairs at all today.
“How’s your headache?” Tic asked, and Rachel brushed his question away. “I’m fine,” she answered, forcing a smile. “Just tired. I wanted to say hi before I went to bed. You need anything?”
“Nope. I’m all set.” Tic’s eyes rested on the ham radio. “Have you checked in with Buster today?”
Mom shook her head. Why should she? His answers were always the same. Miss Cecelia was right. Rachel needed to stop wallowing. She needed to get her body and her brain functioning again. And she couldn’t do that if every day her hopes were dashed to pieces by Buster’s old voice on the other end of that stupid piece of machinery.
“I’m pretty tired,” she repeated. “Maybe we can just check in tomorrow morning.”
Tic’s face fell, and Rachel hated herself. Were these calls just as important to Tic as they were to her? She’d never even thought about that.
Something else Miss Cecelia told her replayed in her mind: Women’ve been caring for their families for centuries. That’s just what mothers do. 
And it was true. Somehow, even so long ago during the worst of her postpartum incapacitation, Rachel had managed to make sure her children were fed and clothed. And now, through the sleepless nights, the terrible anxiety for her daughter and husband, Rachel had made sure Tic’s leg healed up.
A woman will do anything to take care of her family. 
Rachel sighed. She knew the pain would pierce her soul like a knife and leave a wound that could never heal over. But she flicked the switch on the radio, even though the small lever felt like it could have burned a blister into her skin.
After making sure she wasn’t interrupting anyone else’s transmission, she pressed down on the mic. “This is Rachel Winters in Glennallen. Buster, do you have a copy?”

***

Tic had seen his mom cry before. She cried at Dani’s funeral. She cried when Dad left. She cried the first time Miss Cecelia changed his bandage after Dick’s attack.
But he’d never seen her break down completely like she did when Dad’s voice came on the other end of the old, beat-up ham radio.
“Caleb? Oh, thank God. It’s really you. Thank you, Jesus. I’ve been waiting so long … I almost didn’t call in. Thank you, God, thank you, God. Are you all right? Why did it take so long? Is everything okay? It’s really you, isn’t it?”
Dad’s voice sounded different, but Tic didn’t know if that was because of the radio or something else. He strained his ears while Dad explained how he and Griz had to walk all the way to Delta, how long it had taken, how cold it had been. 
It could have been a stranger speaking for as much as it sounded like his father.
“But you made it to Delta?” Mom insisted on hearing the news several times. “You’re at Buster’s now, and you’re all right?”
“We’re at Buster’s now,” he repeated. “How are you? How’s Tic?”
“He’s here,” Mom answered, wiping her tears and holding out the microphone.
Tic stared at it lamely for a second. “Uh, hi, Dad.”
“Hi, son.” So that was it. No name-calling. No moron or idiot or puny baby. Just hi, son.
What had happened to his father? What had happened to both of them?
“You doing okay?” Dad asked, and for a minute Tic wasn’t sure if he should mention his leg. It wasn’t as if there was anything Dad could do about it all the way out in Delta. He glanced at Mom.
“We had an incident,” she said, and Tic could hear the forced cheer in her voice. “Everyone’s fine now, but Dick Jacobson came over here wanting to cause trouble. Tic got his leg hurt, but Miss Cecelia’s helping him out. He’s healing up fine and doing great.”
Her hand was shaking. There was silence on the other end. Was she still holding the talk button down?
“Dick Jacobson?” There was ice and steel in Dad’s voice. Now he sounded even more like an imposter.
Mom cast a nervous glance around the room, but Tic had no idea what she might be looking for. “It’s fine now,” she reassured the stranger on the other line. “AJ and Junior are here staying with us, too.” There was more false happiness and bravado in her tone when she added, “The kids are actually doing really well. Dev’s been giving them all skiing lessons …” Her voice trailed off, and she bit her lip.
Tic didn’t know if Dad’s silence was a lag on the radio or something else, but he didn’t wait to find out. He took the mic from Mom. “Hey, you staying warm enough, old man?” He hoped the transmitter didn’t catch the slight quiver in his voice.
“Warmer than you’d be, shivering off your skinny little butt.”
Tic grinned, and for a flash, he could feel his Dad’s warm love and approval.
The three of them talked for a few more minutes. Dad and Griz would stay with Buster for one night, maybe two, while they gathered their strength. They still had a long journey ahead of them. If it had taken them this long just to get to Delta …
“I need to go,” Dad finally said. 
Tic felt a lump in his throat. Mom just nodded at the radio and clutched the microphone close to her heart.
“I think of you every minute of every day,” Dad continued, speaking into the silence. “When I get tired or cold or hungry, it’s you and Tic and Yaya I think of, and that’s what gives me strength. You are everything to me, the most important treasure in the entire world. Rachel, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to bring us back together again. I miss you every minute, with every fiber of my being. I love you so much, baby.”
If Tic weren’t so tired, he would have grabbed his crutches and given his parents some privacy, but his leg ached, he had nowhere else to go, and he had no idea when he’d hear his father’s voice again.
“I pray for you every single day,” Mom promised.
“I know,” Dad answered. “I can feel it. Don’t stop. Please don’t stop. I’d be lost without you.”
“I love you more than anything. We love you,” Mom emphasized.
Suddenly Tic was seized with the full realization of how many more miles his dad had to travel before they’d see each other again, how many things could go wrong … “I love you, Dad,” he added impulsively. “You’re a great dad. For an idiot.”
“I love you both.” Dad’s voice sounded tearful. “I promise …” He stopped and Tic could hear him suck in a deep breath. “I don’t know how long it’ll take, but I promise that I’m going to do everything I can to bring us all back together.”
“I know.” Mom was openly crying again, and Tic realized that he was squeezing and tensing every muscle in his body. His jaw ached. His leg throbbed.
“I love you both,” Dad said. “So much.”
“I love you, Dad,” Tic called out, practically shouting the words as if that would make them carry more effectively, as if that would make his dad feel their truth even more intensely.
He and Mom both stared at the small radio in silence for several minutes even after the transmission ended.
 


31. SUNDAY’S COMING

Together again. Caleb and Yaya, happy and safe and sound. Beside them Tic, his leg fully healed, and Cammy, happily wagging her stump at this gathering of everyone she loved. The whole house full of guests welcoming the weary travelers home. 
They were feasting on the clam chowder Rachel always made for special occasions. It paired perfectly with Angel’s sourdough. Everything was exactly as it should be and better, the food and the company and the entire scene bringing warmth and a sense of safety she hadn’t felt since the day her husband left.
“I’m so happy we’re together again,” Caleb told her, holding a history of months and years and lifetimes in their shared gaze. “I’m so happy that you’re mine.”
“I’ll always be yours,” Rachel responded. Leaning into him, she felt his warmth, his strength, seeping courage and healing power into her soul. 
“I’m not the same man I was when I left home,” he admitted, but she shook her head, refusing to hear any more. “You’re my husband. You’re all I ever wanted.” She gestured to her family, their friends, the feast spread out on the table before them. “This is all I ever wanted.”
“And Lord willing, you’ll have it all again,” Caleb whispered in her ear. “Because I’m coming back home to you. I promise.”
“I know,” she whispered, and even after she woke up, the warmth of her husband’s love surrounded her like the mist on the mountains on a cold winter morning.
“Lord willing,” she whispered again, and before she had time to change her mind or give in to the all-familiar paralyzing heaviness, she got out of bed and dressed for the day.

***

“Get up. They’re here.” Lilly’s voice was filled with hope and happiness as she shook Yaya awake. 
Yaya stared at her friend’s joyful face and tried to focus on what she was saying. “Who’s here?” Yaya asked, trying to blink the grogginess and cold and hunger away.
“The soldiers,” Lilly practically squealed. “They’re here. They have food and water and are setting up first aid stations over by Bartlett Hall. Zeke already went and came back with a sandwich and canned peaches and guess what else? They have coffee!” She yanked Yaya’s arm. 
“Okay. I’m awake. I’m up.” 
Was this a dream? Had she actually heard right? “Did you say coffee?”
“Yes.” Lilly was tugging, giggling, buzzing with joy. “And some of them are cute, too. Come on.”
Yaya was fully awake now, as if that first jolt of hot caffeine had already rushed into her veins, and she looked around for her coat.
“Wait.” The voice was deep. Harsh. Familiar but not exactly.
She stared up at Boone. 
“Wait,” he repeated.
She offered him a smile. Was he still tired? Was that why he looked the way he did? Like he was angry. Or threatened. Possibly even the slightest bit scared. 
But she knew him so much better than that. Especially now, after all this time they’d spent together …
“You can’t leave.” His fingers gripped her arm, and she’d lost so much weight his whole hand wrapped itself around her bicep easily.
“Hey, let her go.” Lilly stepped toward him. When he didn’t move, she actually shoved his chest. 
Recently, Yaya had sensed that her friend was jealous of the extra time she was spending with Boone, but she’d never seen her react toward him with open hostility like this. 
“What are you doing?” Yaya demanded.
“He can’t keep you here. I’m telling you, there’s food out there. Food and coffee and fresh water. Drinking water.”
Boone shook his head, an air of authority and finality in the one simple gesture. “We’re not going anywhere.”
Lilly waved her hand in the air. “You do whatever you want, but Yaya’s an adult and she can make up her own mind.” She tugged again on Yaya’s arm, the one that wasn’t stuck in Boone’s vise-like grip.
“Come on,” Lilly said. “Let’s go.”
But Yaya didn’t move. She couldn’t.
She didn’t know why Boone wanted her to stay, but he must have his reasons. Maybe this strange arrival on campus was some kind of ploy. Maybe the soldiers weren’t American at all. Maybe this was a trick or a trap or … who knew?
She looked into Boone’s eyes, her entire body melting with relief when she saw the fierce protectiveness in his blue eyes, the assurance that he was looking out for her. That he cared about her.
“Tell your friend she can do whatever she wants,” he told Yaya, never blinking, never taking his gaze away from hers. “You and I have all that we’ll ever need right here.”

***

Tic couldn’t remember ever attending a Good Friday service before. Maybe his church did them and they just blended into all the other church services he went to, but nothing about tonight jostled his memory.
Dev insisted that none of the songs they sang tonight could be about the resurrection. The only goal today was to focus on Jesus on the cross. Tic thought it was rather depressing, and after last night, he couldn’t remain completely stoic and impassive while he led the singing on the guitar.
After days of scouring and searching, he and AJ had finally found enough songs about the crucifixion. There was Dad’s favorite hymn, The Old Rugged Cross, and the one Mom liked, O Sacred Head, Now Wounded. Then Tic had found Were You There, which the hymnal said was an African American spiritual, and a few others that felt appropriate. He was glad when the complete set was over and hoped that he’d picked the right balance of music to match the solemn occasion.
The day commemorated the saddest, most tragic event in human history, but Tic’s heart was soaring, racing, rejoicing.
Dad was alive. 
After the singing, Junior read Psalm 22, the same passage Jesus quoted when he hung on the cross. Then Priyah sang another song while her brother accompanied her on the guitar. For being so shy and quiet when she talked, she could actually sing really well. 
Finally, it was time for Tic and AJ to share the last part of the Good Friday service they’d planned together. AJ was too self-conscious to read it out loud with him, so Tic held his notebook and began by himself.
“So, every Good Friday, my dad liked to play this thing on YouTube,” he explained by way of preamble. “It’s this clip from a pastor and it’s called Sunday’s Coming, and it sort of became like a tradition in our family. And I couldn’t remember all the words or anything, and obviously we can’t stream it anymore. So AJ and I worked together, and we made up our own version.” He stared down at his notebook and cleared his throat.
“It’s Friday,” he began. He had already decided he wasn’t going to try to match the pastor’s low, melodic voice but would just read the words as he and AJ had written them down. “Jesus is on the cross. Mary is crying. The disciples are scared. But Sunday’s coming.”
Interested in what was happening, Cammy came over, resting her head on his lap and nudging his hand until he reached out to pet her silky fur. 
“It’s Friday,” he continued. “Judas is full of remorse. Simon Peter is full of shame. The dying thief is full of fear and pain. But Sunday’s coming.”
He felt his voice rising, his pulse quickening. “It’s Friday. The sky is dark. The heavens are weeping. The angels are mourning. The Son of God hangs on the cross. The men who followed him are struck with terror. The women who loved him are gripped by grief. They don’t know that Sunday’s coming.”
While his heart thudded in his chest, Tic could almost hear the cries of Mary and the disciples at the foot of the cross. His memories flashed back to Dani, buried in their backyard. The night of Dick’s attack, the hunting knife slicing open his leg. The fear for Cammy, for his father, for his sister. The guilt for not sparing his mother from terror, for not being able to wipe the worry and the heaviness and the depression away for her.
The hunger pangs that had recently crescendoed to a persistent howl in the background of each and every day.
He turned the page in his notebook. This was where he and AJ had deviated the most from the original. He hoped nobody thought it was too sacrilegious. Maybe they shouldn’t have changed it so much.
“It’s Friday.” His voice was quieter now. More uncertain. He glanced up at AJ, who gave him an encouraging nod.
“The grid is fallen. The power is off. The people are hungry and scared. Some have died. Some are far away from home.”
He heard a sniffle but didn’t look up from the page. If he saw Mom crying, he wouldn’t be able to finish.
“It’s Friday,” he repeated. “We’re cold and we’re scared, and there’s a lot about the future we don’t know yet. But there’s one thing we do know.” A smile spread across his face. Strength surged through his entire body. He looked up at everyone around him, Mom included, and couldn’t keep the hope from pouring out of his soul and into his words.
“We don’t know when the power will be restored. We don’t know where my sister is. We don’t know when my dad will be returning home. But there’s one thing that we do know. Sunday’s coming.”

To Be Continued 

 


NOTE FROM THE AUTHORS


We’re so glad you joined us on the Winters’ adventure of faith and survival. This is a story the two of us started brainstorming at least a decade ago when we’d drive our family from Glennallen to Anchorage and think of all the dangers that lay on the big highway between home and the nearest city.
