## Design Brief Summary

### For Professional Designers or AI Generation:

**Concept:** Capture the isolation and faith-driven resilience of an Alaska-based family surviving a global catastrophe.

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. Setting: Remote Alaskan wilderness (mountains, snow, dark sky)
2. Threat: Ominous green aurora suggesting technological disaster
3. Hope: Warm light source (cabin window, fire, candle)
4. Typography: Bold, readable title with clear author attribution

**Mood:** Tense yet hopeful, isolated yet community-minded, cold exterior with warm faith center

**Color Strategy:** High contrast between cold blues/greens (threat, environment) and warm oranges/ambers (hope, faith, family)

**Typography Strategy:** Bold, survival-oriented fonts for title; clean, professional for author names

**Thumbnail Test:** Must be legible and visually striking at 100px width

**Genre Signals:** Must clearly communicate:
- Thriller/suspense (through dramatic lighting, ominous elements)
- Christian content (through symbolism: light, cross, hope imagery—avoid being preachy)
- Survival fiction (through harsh environment, isolation)
- Alaska setting (through landscape, winter elements)

---

## Additional Notes for Cover Design

### What to AVOID:
- Overly cheesy Christian imagery (glowing angels, obvious crosses everywhere)
- Too much green (aurora should be accent, not dominant)
- Cluttered composition (keep it clean and dramatic)
- Weak typography (must work at thumbnail size)
- Generic stock photo look (needs custom, unique feel)
- Too dark (needs warm accent for hope)

### What to EMPHASIZE:
- Alaska's majestic but harsh beauty
- Contrast between technology failure and human resilience
- Faith as subtle undercurrent (light imagery) not overt preaching
- Family/community without being saccharine
- Professional thriller aesthetics
- Unique, memorable composition

### Series Considerations:
This is Book 1 of a planned series. Cover design should:
- Allow for consistent branding across multiple books
- Use repeatable elements (color scheme, typography, layout style)
- Be distinctive enough to stand out but flexible for variations
- Consider: Same location/different seasons, same typography/different scenes, etc.
